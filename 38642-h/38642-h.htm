<p>Although the services of <span class="smcap">General Lafayette</span> to the
United States were rendered chiefly in the military line,
yet he contributed very essentially by his efforts, and the
weight of his personal character, to promote the interests
of our foreign relations. When he left the United States
at the close of the year 1781, Congress instructed the
American Ministers abroad to consult him on the public
affairs of the United States. His correspondence with
Congress, now to be published, will show how effectually
he executed his trust in this respect, and how deeply and
constantly he watched over the interests of his adopted
country, long after his return to Europe. These letters
are a testimony not more of his patriotism, love of liberty,
the warmth of his affections, and the fulness of his gratitude,
than of his close observation, correct opinions, and
enlarged views on political affairs.</p>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, November 23d, 1781.</p>

<p>On the report of a Committee, consisting of Mr Carroll,
Mr Madison, and Mr Cornell, to whom was referred a
letter of the 22d, from Major-General the Marquis de Lafayette,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That Major-General the Marquis de Lafayette,
have permission to go to France; and that he return
at such time as shall be most convenient to him.</p>

<p>That he be informed, that on a review of his conduct
throughout the past campaign, and particularly during the
period in which he had the chief command in Virginia, the
many new proofs, which present themselves of his zealous
attachment to the cause he has espoused, and of his judgment,
vigilance, gallantry, and address in its defence, have
greatly added to the high opinion entertained by Congress
of his merits and military talents.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>That he make known to the officers and troops whom
he commanded during that period, that the brave and
enterprising services with which they seconded his
zeal and efforts, and which enabled him to defeat the attempts
of an enemy far superior in numbers, have been
beheld by Congress with particular satisfaction and approbation.</p>

<p>That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs acquaint the Ministers
Plenipotentiary of the United States, that it is the
desire of Congress that they should confer with the Marquis
de Lafayette, and avail themselves of his information
relative to the situation of public affairs in the United
States.</p>

<p>That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs further acquaint
the Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles,
that he will conform to the intention of Congress by consulting
with, and employing the assistance of the Marquis
de Lafayette, in accelerating the supplies, which may be
afforded by his Most Christian Majesty for the use of the
United States.</p>

<p>That the Superintendent of Finance, the Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, and the Board of War, make such communication
to the Marquis de Lafayette, touching the
affairs of their respective departments, as will best enable
him to fulfil the purpose of the two resolutions immediately
preceding.</p>

<p>That the Superintendent of Finance take order for
discharging the engagement entered into by the Marquis
de Lafayette with the merchants of Baltimore referred to
in the act of the 24th of May last.</p>

<p>That the Superintendent of Finance furnish the Marquis
de Lafayette with a proper conveyance to France.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Antony, near Paris, March 30th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have been honored with your letter by the Hermione,
and have made the best use I could of the intelligence you
were pleased to communicate. The sailing of the Alliance
was unexpected, and I could not improve that opportunity.
This letter will be carried by a vessel that is immediately
despatched. I shall soon have an opportunity to write by
a frigate. Dr Franklin, whom I have acquainted with the
departure of this vessel, has no doubt communicated very
important intelligence. Mahon has been taken rather
sooner than was expected; the siege of Gibraltar is going
on, and some do not consider it impossible that it should
fall into the hands of the Spaniards. The taking of St
Kitts was felt in England; the more so, as Sir Samuel
Hood had given great expectations of preserving the Island.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of confusion in England, which
their late resolutions clearly prove; many think the loss of
the majority is a <i>finesse</i> of Lord North; but from later advices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
it appears there will be a change of Ministers. The
opposition members do not agree together, and none of
them are true friends to America; none of them are wishing
for independence; they want to make the best bargain
they can, either with France, at the expense of America,
or by satisfying America at the cheapest rate. By Mr
Adams's letters I find Holland is about acknowledging
American independence, as far as it will neither cost them
blood nor money; but at this period I think it important to
obtain such a political advantage.</p>

<p>I beg you will please to communicate the contents of my
letter to Congress; as I do not enter into any particulars
with the President. Accept the assurance of the high
esteem and most affectionate sentiments with which I
am, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signed">
LAFAYETTE.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> Since writing the above, we have just got certain
intelligence that Lord North has left his place. It is
generally believed he will be replaced by Lord Rockingham.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">St Germain, June 25th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>It is needless for me to enter into such details as will of
course be communicated to Congress by the Minister.
Dr Franklin will doubtless be very particular. But as
Congress have been pleased to order that I should give
my opinion, I now have the honor to tell you what I think
upon the several transactions that have lately taken place.</p>

<p>Before the change of Ministry, the old Administration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
had sent people to feel the pulse of the French Court and
of the American Ministers. They had reasons to be convinced
that neither of the two could be deceived into separate
arrangements, that would break the union and make
both their enemies weaker. In the meanwhile, a cabal
was going on against the old Ministry. New appointments
took place, and it is not known how far Lord North would
have gone towards a general negotiation.</p>

<p>It had ever been the plan of the opposition to become
masters of the Cabinet. But while every one of them
united against the Ministry, they committed this strange
blunder, never to think what would become of them after
their views had been fulfilled. They even made Ministers,
and upon the same day they did not know how to divide
the prey; upon the second they perceived that they had
different interests and different principles to support; upon
the third they were intriguing against each other. And
now the British Ministry are so much divided, that nothing
but their disputes can account for their indecision in public
affairs.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Rockingham has nothing of a Minister,
but the parade of levees, and a busy appearance. He is
led by Mr Burke. He is also upon the best terms with
Charles Fox. The principles of the latter everybody
knows. That party it appears is on one side of the Administration.</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton and Lord Camden think it their
interest to support Lord Shelburne, whom, however, they
inwardly dislike. The Earl of Shelburne seems to have
by far the greater share in the King's confidence. He is
intriguing, and, upon a pretence to follow Lord Chatham's
opinions, he makes himself agreeable to the King by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
opposing American independence. He is, they say, a
faithless man, wishing for a continuation of the war, by
which he hopes to raise his own importance; and, should
the Rockingham party fall, should Lord Shelburne be
found to divide power with another party, he is not far, it
is said, from uniting with Lord North and many others in
the old Administration.</p>

<p>The King stands alone, hating every one of his Ministers,
grieving at every measure that combats his dispositions,
and wishing for the moment when the present Ministry,
having lost their popularity, will give way to those
whom he has been obliged to abandon for a time.</p>

<p>Such is the position in which they stand, and I am going
to relate the measures they have taken towards negotiation.</p>

<p>It appears Lord Shelburne, on the one hand, and Charles
Fox on the other, went upon the plan which Lord North
had adopted, to make some private advances, but they
neither communicated their measures to each other, nor
said at first anything of it in the Cabinet. Count de Vergennes
said that France could never think to enter into a
treaty, but in concurrence with her allies, and upon being
told that America herself did not so much insist upon asking
for independence, he answered, "people need not ask
for what they have got." Mr Adams in Holland, and Dr
Franklin in Paris, made such answers as were consistent
with the dignity of the United States. But they as well as
Count de Vergennes, expressed a sincere desire for peace,
upon liberal and generous terms.</p>

<p>From the very beginning Mr Adams has been persuaded,
that the British Ministry were not sincere&mdash;that the greater
part of them were equally against America as any in the
old Administration, and that all those negotiations were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
much to be depended upon. His judgment of this affair
has been confirmed by the events; though at present the
negotiation has put on a better outward appearance.</p>

<p>Dr Franklin's pen is better able than mine can be, to
give you all the particulars through which Mr Grenville, a
young man of some rank, is now remaining in Paris, with
powers to treat with his Most Christian Majesty, and all
other Princes or States now at war with Great Britain.</p>

<p>I shall only remark, that in late conversations with Count
de Vergennes, Mr Grenville has considered the acknowledgment
of independence as a matter not to be made a
question of, but to be at once and previously declared.
But upon Count de Vergennes's writing down Mr Grenville's
words to have them signed by him, the gentleman,
instead of this expression, "the King of England has <i>resolved</i>
at once to acknowledge," &amp;c., insisted to have the
words <i>is disposed</i> made use of in what he intended to be
considered as his official communication. He has also
evinced a backwardness in giving Dr Franklin a copy of
his powers; and their Ministry are so backward also in
bringing before Parliament a bill respecting American independence,
that it does not show a great disposition towards
a peace, the preliminaries of which must be an acknowledgment
of America as a separate and independent
nation.</p>

<p>It is probable that within these two days, Dr Franklin
had some communication with Mr Grenville, which may
throw some light upon the late points I have just now mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr Jay is arrived from Madrid. Mr Laurens, it seems,
intends to return home. Mr Adams's presence in Holland
is for the moment necessary. A few days will make us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
better acquainted with the views of Great Britain; and
since the Ministers from Congress have thought that I
ought for the service of America to remain here some time
longer, I shall, under their direction devote myself to promote
the interests of the United States. The footing I am
upon at this Court enables me sometimes to go greater
lengths than could be done by a foreigner. But unless an
immediate earnest negotiation, which I am far from hoping,
renders my services very useful, I will beg leave to return
to my labors, and be employed in a shorter way to ensure
the end of this business, than can be found in political dissertation.</p>

<p>I have communicated the opinion of Mr Adams, such as
I found it in his letter. Dr Franklin's ideas will be presented
by himself, and also those of Mr Jay, both of which
must be preferable to mine, though I do not believe
they much differ. But from what I have collected by
communications with your Ministers, with those of the
French, and by private intelligence, I conclude;</p>

<p>1st. That the British Ministry are at variance between
themselves, embarrassed upon the conduct they ought to
hold, and not firm in their principles and their places.</p>

<p>2dly. That negotiations will go on shortly, establish
principles, and facilitate a treaty; but that the King of
England and some of the Ministers, have not lost the idea
of breaking the union between France and the United
States.</p>

<p>3dly. That the situation of England, want of men and
money, and the efforts France is about to make, will reduce
the former to a necessity for making peace before the end
of next spring.</p>

<p>America will no doubt exert herself, and send back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
every emissary to her Plenipotentiaries here; for the Ministry
in England are now deceiving the people with the
hope that &mdash;&mdash; is going to operate a reconciliation, and
with many his &mdash;&mdash; of the same nature.</p>

<p>In the course of this affair, we have been perfectly satisfied
with the French Ministry. They have proved candid
and moderate. Mr Jay will write about Spain. Very
little is to be said of her, and by her very little is to be
done. It appears Holland is going on well, and I believe
Mr Adams is satisfied, except upon the affair of money,
which is the difficult point, and goes on very slowly.</p>

<p>By all I can see, I judge that if America insists on a
share in the fisheries, she will obtain it by the general
treaty; this point is too near my heart to permit me not
to mention it.</p>

<p>The news of Count de Grasse's defeat has been very
much felt in France, and the whole nation was made truly
unhappy by this disagreeable event. The general cry
of the people was such, that I do not believe any French
Admiral will, in any case take upon himself to surrender
his own ship. The people at large have perhaps been too
severe, and government have not pronounced, as there is
to be a court martial. But I was happy to see a patriotic
spirit diffused through every individual. The States of
several Provinces, the great cities, and a number of different
associations of men, have offered ships of the line to a
greater number than have been lost. In the meanwhile,
government are using the greatest activity, and this has
given a spur to the national exertions. But independent
of the stroke in itself, I have been sighing upon the ruin
of the plans I had proposed towards a useful co-operation
upon the coasts of America. My schemes have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
made almost impracticable, and my voyage (the case of
negotiations excepted) has not been so serviceable to the
public, as I had good reasons to expect.</p>

<p>The Spaniards are going at last to besiege Gibraltar.
Count d'Artois, the King of France's brother, and the Duc
de Bourbon, a Prince of the blood, are just setting out to
serve there as volunteers. They intend to begin in the first
days of September; so that we may expect one way or
other to get rid of that encumbrance, and let the siege
succeed or miscarry, we may expect hereafter to make
use of the combined forces of the House of Bourbon.</p>

<p>We are waiting for intelligence from the East Indies,
where it appears we have got a superiority, and are entitled
to expect good news from that quarter. The enemy
had some despatches by land, but either our operations
are of a later date, or they only have published a part of
their intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Paris, June 29th.</i> Dr Franklin and Mr Jay will acquaint
you with Count de Vergennes's answer to Mr
Grenville, and also with what Mr Grenville has said respecting
the enabling act. This act and also the answer
to Count de Vergennes, are every day expected in Paris,
and the way in which both will be expressed may give us
a pretty just idea upon the present intentions of the British
Ministry. The only thing that remains for me to inform
you of, is, that under the pretence of curiosity, admiration,
or private affairs, England will probably send emissaries
to America, who cannot hope to insinuate themselves
under any other but a friendly appearance.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, September 18th, 1782.</p>

<p>You should not, my Dear Sir, have been thus long without
hearing from me, had I not persuaded myself, that I
should see you before a letter could reach you. I still entertain
this hope from a passage in Dr Franklin's letter,
but have been in this often disappointed; I will not indulge
it longer, so far as to let it arrest my pen.</p>

<p>The Count de Segur delivered me your letters of April.
I thank you sincerely for having made him the bearer of
them, since you know the eagerness with which I embrace
your friends, even without taking into consideration, that
merit which makes them so. The Count leaves town for
the army today, so that I shall not have the full benefit of
your introduction to him till next winter, when I flatter
myself you will join our circle. The Prince de Broglio
told me last night, that he had a letter from you to me.
I expect to see him here this morning.</p>

<p>I cannot help remarking the just estimate you made of
the British Ministry. Late events have fully justified it.
They are made up of heterogeneous particles, and, as
might naturally be expected, they begin to fly off from
each other. You have nothing to apprehend from your
adopted country. We are immovably fixed in our determination
to adhere to our allies, in spite of every endeavor
to change our sentiments. I am sorry that I have
not leisure to enlarge. My horses wait to carry me to
the banks of the Hudson, while I write; let me however
inform you of the misfortune that has happened to Chevalier
de Latouche; his frigate being pursued by the enemy
was run on shore in the Delaware, and is lost. The gentlemen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
his passengers, are however happily saved, together
with the money and papers. Everything else is
lost, and what is most to be lamented, he himself must
have fallen into the hands of the enemy. The flag that
went to inquire his fate is not yet returned.</p>

<p>The fleet of the Marquis de Vaudreuil has also sustained
a loss in the sinking of the Magnifique, in the harbor of
Boston. Congress have endeavored to repair this, by presenting
the America to his Majesty.</p>

<p>The troops from Virginia have joined those on the Hudson.
Our army is in noble order at present; you will be
charmed to see our countrymen well dressed, since you
used to admire them even in their rags.</p>

<p>I send you the papers for a month back; they contain
all our public news, and some particulars worthy your attention.</p>

<p class="indent1">I am, my Dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, November 2d, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The confusion occasioned by the misfortune of the
Eagle, and the delay that the gentlemen who saved their
baggage experienced in getting here, prevented my receiving
your favor of the 25th and 29th of July till the last of
September, although I had acknowledged the receipt of the
letters, by the same conveyance, much earlier.</p>

<p>Your letter contained so much important matter, that it
was laid before Congress, for knowing it would be advantageous
to you and place your assiduity and attention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
their interests in its strongest point of light. I choose to
consider most of yours as public letters; this last was particularly
acceptable, as neither Dr Franklin nor Mr Jay had
been so explicit, as we had reason to expect. Our system
of politics has been so much the same for a long time, tending
only to one point, a determination to support the war
till we can make peace in conjunction with our allies, that
the whole history of our Cabinet amounts to nothing more
than a reiteration of the same sentiments in different language;
and so plain is our political path, so steadily do we
walk in it, that I can add nothing to what I have already
written you on that subject.</p>

<p>The events of the campaign are as uninteresting; the
inactivity and caution of the enemy have given us leisure
to form the finest army this country ever saw, while they
conspire to render that army useless for the present. The
troops are gone into winter quarters; ours at Fishkill,
West Point, and its vicinity; the French as far east as
Hartford.</p>

<p>This day we are informed from New York, that fourteen
sail of the line, one of forty guns, and seven frigates,
sailed from thence on the 26th. We cannot learn that
they had troops on board or under convoy.</p>

<p>The Magnifique is lost, I believe without hope of recovery.
She will, however, be well replaced by the America,
which all accounts concur in calling a fine ship. But
unless your fleet is very considerably strengthened in those
seas, another campaign may slip away as uselessly as the
last; for I see no reason to suppose, while Lord Shelburne
is at the head of Administration, that the negotiations for
peace will wear a serious aspect. I believe with you, that
his royal master is set upon risking everything, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
acknowledge our independence, and as he possesses the
art of seduction in a very eminent degree, it will require
more firmness to resist his solicitations, than is generally
found among courtiers. I am very much pleased to hear
that the siege of Gibraltar is at last undertaken, with some
prospects of success. This I sincerely wish. England
has found in that single fortress a more powerful ally than
any other she could make in Europe. It has for the most
part employed the navy of Spain, and cost them five ships
of the line.</p>

<p>You need feel no anxiety on the score of an apology for
your absence; everybody here attributes it to its true
cause, and considers it as a new proof of your attachment
to the interests of America.</p>

<p>The papers I send with this will serve to confirm this
assertion. I thank you for the acquaintance of the Prince
de Broglio and the Count de Segur; they handed me
your letters the day I was unfortunately obliged to leave
town. They have, however, promised to be here this
winter, and to give me an opportunity of consoling myself
for your absence by the attention they will enable me to
show to those you love. Your brother-in-law is gone I
find to the siege of Gibraltar. I beg you to write particularly
to remind him of his American friends. He shall hear
from me by the first opportunity; in the meanwhile, tell
him he will not do justice to our expectations if he neglects
to promote the great object, which we discussed together a
little before he left this country, foreseeing then that he
would ere long be called to Spain. I ought not to conclude
this without informing you, that the chair of state is transferred
to Mr Boudinot, Mr Hanson's term having expired.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Brest, December 3d, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to beg the attention of Congress
upon a subject, which, though it appears personal, may
bring about events of public utility.</p>

<p>On a past voyage I have had the happiness to return
with such means as proved useful to the United States,
and when I embarked last, I had a leave of absence
till such a time as I would think proper.</p>

<p>What has been done respecting former demands of
money, has been communicated to Congress. As to
the late ones, I leave it to the Ministers of Congress
to give an account of those transactions.</p>

<p>I have the heartfelt happiness to think, that I did
not leave Versailles until I had, to the utmost, exerted
every means in my power; and I wish they had been
an aid to promote every view of Congress and every
interest of the United States.</p>

<p>The Ministers of Congress in Europe have in former
letters acquainted them with the request they
made, that I should defer my departure to America.
They thought I might serve her in the political field,
and I yielded to their opinion.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, that I am going to embark, I have done
it by their advice. Upon the voyage, the mode and
the time of it, I have taken their opinion, and it has
been, that I was acting consistent with the interests of
America, and the instructions of General Washington.
But I could not submit to think, that any member of
Congress, might, from public report, imagine that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
enlarge so far their permission, as to follow pursuits,
that would not particularly promote the views of
America; and as they do not choose being intruded
upon with minute details of military plans, let it suffice
to say, that I beg leave to refer them to the opinion
of General Washington.</p>

<p>With a heart bound to America by every sentiment
of a grateful, an everlasting, and, I may add, a patriotic
love,</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, January 10th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I was honored by yours of the 14th of October last.
It contains much useful information, and upon the
whole exhibits a pleasing picture of our affairs in Europe.
Here the scene is more chequered with good
and evil; the last I think predominates. The want of
money has excited very serious discontents in the army.
They have formed committees. A very respectable
one, with General McDougal at their head, is
now here. Their demands, though strictly just, are
such as Congress have not the means of satisfying.
The states upon whom they call, complain of inability.
Peace is wished for with more anxiety than it should
be; wearied out with the length of the war, the people
will reluctantly submit to the burdens they bore at
the beginning of it; in short, peace becomes necessary.
If the war continues we shall lean heavier upon
France than we have done. If peace is made she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
must add one obligation more to those she has already
imposed. She must enable us to pay off our army; or
we may find the reward of her exertions and ours suspended
longer than we could wish.</p>

<p>Charleston is at length evacuated; the enemy made
a convention with General Greene and were suffered
to depart in peace. In one of the papers I send you,
you will see the general orders at going off.</p>

<p>The embarkation of your army, before the war in
this country had closed, gave me some pain. Their
stay might have answered useful political purposes,
had they been at hand to operate against New York,
which they will not otherwise quit.</p>

<p>Congress saw this in its true light, but were too delicate
to mention it; I enclose their resolutions on being
apprized of it. You speak of operations in America.
I agree with you, that they are devoutly to be
wished, both by France and by us; but if they are to
depend upon operations in the West Indies, it is ten
to one but they fail. The machine is too complex.
If it is to be worked in any part by Spanish springs,
the chance against it is still greater, for whatever the
latter may be in Europe, in the West Indies they lose
their elasticity.</p>

<p>The great cause between Connecticut and Pennsylvania
has been decided in favor of the latter. It is a
singular event. There are few instances of independent
States submitting their cause to a Court of Justice.
The day will come, when all disputes in the great republic
of Europe will be tried in the same way; and
America be quoted to exemplify the wisdom of the
measure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>Adieu my Dear Sir, continue to love this country,
for though she owes you much, she will repay you all
with interest, when in ages to come she records you
with her patriots and heroes.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, with the sincerest
esteem and regard, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, AT MADRID.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Cadiz, January 20th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your letter of the 14th has this day come to hand.
The occasion of it I lament, but it becomes my duty to
answer it.</p>

<p>From an early period, I had the happiness to rank
among the foremost in the American revolution. In the
affection and confidence of the people, I am proud to say,
I have a great share. Congress honors me so far as to
direct, that I am to be consulted by their European Ministers,
which circumstances I do not mention out of vanity,
but only to show, that in giving my opinion, I am called
upon by dictates of honor and duty, which it becomes me
to obey.</p>

<p>The measure being right, it is beneath me to wait for a
private opportunity. Public concerns have a great weight
with me, but nothing upon earth can intimidate me into
selfish considerations. To my opinion you are entitled,
and I offer it with the freedom of a heart that ever shall
be independent.</p>

<p>To France you owe a great deal; to others you owe
nothing. As a Frenchman, whose heart is glowing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
patriotism, I enjoy the part France has acted, and the
connexion she has made. As an American, I acknowledge
the obligation, and in that I think true dignity consists;
but dignity forbade our sending abroad political
forlorn hopes, and I ever objected to the condescension;
the more so, as a French treaty had secured their allies to
you; and because America is more likely to receive advances,
than to need throwing herself at other people's
feet.</p>

<p>The particulars of the negotiation with Spain I do not
dwell upon. In my opinion they were wrong, but I may
be mistaken. Certain it is, that an exchange of Ministers
ought to have been, and now an exchange of powers must
be, upon equal footing. What England has done is nothing,
either as to the right or the mode. The right consisted
in the people's will, the mode depends upon a consciousness
of American dignity. But if Spain has hitherto declined
to acknowledge what the elder branch of the Bourbons
thought honorable to declare, yet will it be too strange,
that England ranks before her in the date and the benefits
of the acknowledgment.</p>

<p>There are more powers than you know of, who are
making advances to America; some of them I have personally
received; but you easily guess that no treaty would
be so pleasing as the one with Spain. The three natural
enemies of Britain should be strongly united. The French
alliance is everlasting, but such a treaty between the friends
of France is a new tie of confidence and affection. The
Spaniards are slow in their motions, but strong in their attachments.
From a regard to them, but still more out of
regard to France, we must have more patience with them
than with any other nation in Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>But peace is likely to be made, and how then can the
man, who advised against your going at all, propose your
remaining at a Court where you are not decently treated?
Congress, I hope, and through them the whole nation, do
not intend their dignity to be trifled with, and, for my part,
I have no inclination to betray the confidence of the American
people. I expect peace, and I expect Spain to act
by you with propriety; but should they hesitate to treat
you as a public servant of the United States, then, however
disagreeable the task, Mr Carmichael had better go
to Paris where France may stand a mediator, and through
that generous common friend, we may come to the wished
for connexion with the Court of Spain.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Cadiz, February 5th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>On the 7th of December, I had the honor to write
to you from Brest, and my letters down to that date
have contained accounts of our political affairs. Since
which time, I have been taken up in preparations of a
plan that would have turned out to the advantage of
America; indeed, it exceeded my first expectations, and
to my great surprise, the King of Spain had not only consented
his forces should co-operate with us, but on the
consideration of obtaining a necessary diversion, he had
been induced by Count d'Estaing to approve my being
detached into Canada with a French force. Nay, had
the war continued, I think that, if not for love, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
on political motives, they would have consented to offer
pecuniary assistance.</p>

<p>The conditions of the peace I do not dwell upon. I
hope they are such as will be agreeable in America.
They have no doubt been sent from France, and the part
that respects the United States will have been immediately
forwarded for their ratification. I do not hope to send
you the first tidings of a general peace. Yet I have prevailed
upon a small vessel to alter her course, and my own
servant is going with the despatches, to prevent either
neglect or other accidental delays.</p>

<p>On the moment of my arrival at Cadiz, I began a
close correspondence with Mr Carmichael. It at first
respected money matters, but soon took a still more important
turn. Having been officially asked my advice
upon his future conduct, I gave it in a letter, of which
the enclosed is a copy. Whatever light my opinion
may appear in at Madrid, or elsewhere, I think it is
consistent with the dignity of the United States.
Now, Sir, while enjoying the hope of being in a few
weeks on the American shore, I have a letter from Mr
Carmichael, wherein he requests my assistance at Madrid.
How far it may serve him I do not know; but
since I am thought useful, I shall yield to my zeal for
the service of America, I readily give up personal
gratifications. On my arrival at Madrid, I shall have
the honor to give you my opinion of our situation
there. Among the Spaniards we have but few well
wishers, and as they, at the bottom, hate cordially the
French, our alliance, though a political, is not a sentimental
consideration with them. But I wish a settlement
of boundaries may remove the more immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
prospects of dispute. It is, I believe, very important
to America; the more so, as she became a national
ally to France, a national enemy to Britain. But the
Spaniards will be forever extravagant in their territorial
notions, and very jealous of the increase of American
wealth and power. But it is good policy for us
to be upon friendly terms with them, and I wish on
my return to Paris, that I may carry for Mr Jay some
hopes of better success in his Spanish negotiation.</p>

<p>I have just heard that both Floridas were given to
Spain. This accounts for Lord Shelburne's condescension
in fixing our Southern limits. The people of
Florida will, I hope, remove into Georgia. But the
Spaniards will insist upon a pretended right to an extent
of country all along the left shore of the Mississippi.
Not that they mean to occupy it, but because
they are afraid of neighbors that have a spirit of liberty.
I am sorry those people have the Floridas.
But as we cannot help it, we must endeavor to frustrate
Lord Shelburne's views, which I presume are
bent upon a dispute between Spain and the United
States. A day will come, I hope, when Europeans
will have little to do on the northern continent; and
God grant it may ever be for the happiness of mankind
and the propagation of liberty.</p>

<p>On the perusal of my letter to Mr Carmichael, I beg
you will remember it is calculated to undergo the inspection
of both cabinets at Versailles and Madrid;
and to be a proof against the unfriendly connexions of
a Spanish Ministry. Be pleased to tell Mr Morris,
that I remember his want of money extends further
than occasions of war. At the time of my leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
France, I had been made to hope, but do not know for
the present what has taken place. On my arrival at
Madrid, I will be very attentive to that point, but
shall take care to preserve the dignity of the United
States, of which I have a proper and exalted sense.</p>

<p>In my determination to go to Madrid, I have consulted
with Mr Harrison, a gentleman whose residence
at this place enables him to know a great deal about
the Spaniards. He has to this moment acted as a
consul in this place; so far at least, as to serve his
countrymen, and spend his own money; for he has no
public character, and what he has done he undertook
at Mr Jay's request. There ought, I think, to be a
consul at this place, and if the appointment is deferred,
several inconveniences will be laid upon the
American trade. There is no gentleman, exclusive of
what his voluntary services deserve, who could better
fill the place than Mr Harrison, and was I to take the
freedom to advise, I would warmly recommend him
for the appointment.</p>

<p>So far as we know of the Spanish preliminaries,
they give up their claim upon having Gibraltar, but
keep Mahon, and have the two Floridas. The islands
of Providence are returned to England. We hourly
expect a French courier. Tobago excepted, they gave
up their conquests in the West Indies, and have St
Lucia again. Before the vessel is gone I hope to be
more particular. As to the American preliminaries,
they have long ago been sent to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>While I am writing a French courier is arrived.
Enclosed you will find an extract of the preliminaries,
such as they are, sent to me. May I beg you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
please to communicate my letter to General Washington,
though it is a public one, I may ask the favor
from you, as I would otherwise have sent him a copy
of it.</p>

<p>With the highest regard, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signed">LAFAYETTE.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> I have just received a note from the French
Ambassador at Madrid, whereby I find that my letter
had a good effect.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Cadiz, February 5th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Whatever despatch I make in sending a vessel, I do
not flatter myself to apprize Congress with the news
of a general peace; yet such are my feelings on the
occasion, that I cannot defer presenting them with my
congratulations. Upon their knowledge of my heart,
I depend more than upon expressions, which are so
far inadequate to my sentiments. Our early times I
recollect with a most pleasing sense of pride; our
present ones make me easy and happy. To futurity I
look forward in the most delightful prospects.</p>

<p>Former letters have acquainted Congress, that, upon
my intending to leave France, I had been detained by
their Commissioners. To my letter of the 3d of December
I beg leave to refer them for a further account
of my conduct.</p>

<p>Now the noble contest is ended, and I heartily rejoice
at the blessings of peace. Fortynine ships of the
line and twenty thousand men are now here, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
whom Count d'Estaing was to join the combined forces
in the West Indies; and during the summer they
were to co-operate with our American army. Nay, it
had lately been granted, that, whilst Count d'Estaing
acted elsewhere, I should enter the St Lawrence river
at the head of a French corps. So far as respects me,
I have no regret, but, independent of personal gratifications,
it is known that I ever was bent upon the addition
of Canada to the United States.</p>

<p>On the happy prospect of peace I had prepared to
go to America. Never did an idea please me so much
as the hope to rejoice with those to whom I have been
a companion in our labors; but however painful the
delay, I now must defer my departure. In the discharge
of my duty to America no sacrifice shall ever
be wanting, and when it had pleased Congress to direct
that their Ministers should consult with me, it
became my first concern to deserve their confidence.</p>

<p>From my letter to Mr Livingston an opinion may
be formed of our situation in Spain; my advice has
been called for, and I have given it; my presence is
requested, and instead of sailing for America, I am
going to Madrid, being so far on my way; and as Mr
Jay is in Paris, I think it is better for me to go there.
But unless Congress shall honor me with their commands,
I shall embark in the course of June, and am
eager for the moment when I may again enjoy the
sight of the American shores.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, our noble cause has prevailed; our independence
is firmly settled, and American virtue enjoys
its reward. No exertions, I hope, will now be wanting
to strengthen the Federal Union.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>May the States be so bound to each other, as forever
to defy European politics. Upon that union their
consequence, their happiness, will depend. This is
the first wish of a heart more truly American than
words can express.</p>

<p>With the highest respect I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE FLORIDA BLANCA.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">Madrid, February 19th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Having had the honor to confer with your Excellency
on the objects relative to the United States, and
being soon to repair to the American Congress, I
wish to be fully impressed with the result of our conversations.
Instead of the indifference, and even of
the divisions, which another nation would be glad to
foresee, I am happy to have it in my power to inform
the United States of your good dispositions. It is to
you, Sir, I am indebted for this advantage, and in order
to make it complete, and to make myself certain
that I forget nothing, give me leave to submit to your
Excellency the account which I intend to lay before
Congress.</p>

<p>His Catholic Majesty desires, that a lasting confidence
and harmony may subsist between him and the
United States, and he is determined on his part to do
everything that will be necessary to keep it up. The
American <i>Chargé d'Affaires</i> is at this moment received
as such, and your Excellency is going to treat of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
interests of the two nations. As you wish to show Mr
Jay every kind of regard, you wait only till the Count
d'Aranda shall have notified your dispositions to him,
before you present Mr Carmichael to his Majesty.</p>

<p>With respect to the limits, his Catholic Majesty has
adopted those that are determined by the preliminaries
of the 30th of November, between the United
States and the Court of London. The fear of raising
an object of dissension, is the only objection the King
has to the free navigation of the river Mississippi.
The Virginia tobacco, and the naval stores, may furnish
matter for reciprocal conventions in the treaty, and
by means of the productions of America, arrangements
might be made which would be useful to her finances.
When I had the honor to speak to you in favor of a
diminution of the duties on codfish, you answered, that
it would be necessary to give to France a similar advantage,
and that by virtue of former treaties, the
English might set up pretensions to the same; but that
you will do in every respect all that will be in your
power to satisfy America.</p>

<p>I would with very great pleasure touch upon every
detail, which may enter into a connexion between
Spain and the United States, but I am not to be concerned
in this happy work. The Ministers of the
United States, and the one whom you may send thither
are to make it their business, and I content myself
with reminding you of the general ideas you have
given me. A word from you will satisfy me that I
have not omitted anything. The dispositions of his
Catholic Majesty, and the candor of your Excellency,
will leave no pretexts for misrepresentations. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
alliance of the House of Bourbon with the United
States is founded on reciprocal interest; it will still
acquire greater strength from the confidence which
your Excellency wishes to establish.</p>

<p>Such, Sir, are the conclusions, which I have drawn
from our conferences, and the account which I intend
to give to Congress, without having any mission for
that purpose. I am acquainted with the sentiments of
Congress, and I am convinced they will set a just
value upon your dispositions. In permitting me to
acquaint them with these particulars, you will have a
claim to my personal gratitude. To the assurance of
this I join that of the respect, with which I have the
honor, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I cannot comply better with your desire, than by asking
your leave to give you here my answer. You have perfectly
well understood whatever I have had the honor to
communicate to you, with respect to our dispositions

it is his Majesty's intentions to abide, for the present, by
the limits established by the treaty of the 30th of November,
1782, between the English and the Americans, yet
the King intends to inform himself particularly whether it
can be in any ways inconvenient or prejudicial to settle

<p class="letter_head">Madrid, February 22d, 1783.</p>

<p>On receiving the answer of the Count de Florida
Blanca, I desired an explanation respecting the addition
that relates to the limits. I was answered, that it was a
fixed principle to abide by the limits established by the
treaty between the English and Americans, that his remarks
related only to mere unimportant details, which he
wished to receive from the Spanish commandants, which
would be amicably regulated, and would by no means oppose
the general principle. I asked him, before the Ambassador
of France, whether he could give me his word of
honor for it. He answered me, he would, and that I
might engage it to the United States.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Bordeaux, March 2d, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Upon the news of a general peace, I had the honor to
write to you, and took the liberty to address Congress in a
letter, of which the enclosed is a duplicate. Those despatches
have been sent by the Triomphe, a French vessel,
and by her you will also have received a note of the general
preliminaries.</p>

<p>The reasons of my going from Cadiz to Madrid being
known to you, I shall only inform you, that upon my arrival
there, I waited upon the King, and paid a visit to the
Count de Florida Blanca. Independent of my letter to
Mr Carmichael, of which you have a copy, I had very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
openly said, that I expected to return with him to Paris.
So that after the first compliments, it was easy for me to
turn the conversation upon American affairs. I did it with
the more advantage, as I had beforehand fully conversed
with Mr Carmichael, who gave me his opinion upon every
point, and I was happy to find it coincided with mine.</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation, I could see, that
American independence gives some umbrage to the Spanish
Ministry. They fear the loss of their Colonies, and
the success of our revolution appears to be an encouragement
to this fear. Upon this subject their King has odd
notions, as he has indeed upon everything. The reception
of Mr Carmichael they wanted to procrastinate, and
yet they knew it must be done. In offering my opinion
to Count de Florida Blanca, I did it in a very free manner.
I rejected every idea of delay. I gave a description
of America, and of each of the States, of which Count
de Florida Blanca appeared to know very little. While I
abated their fears from our quarter, I endeavored to
awaken them upon other accounts. It is useless to mention
the particulars of this conversation, which lasted very
long, and which he promised to lay before the King. In
two days he said he should pay me a visit at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Agreeably to the appointment, I waited for Count de
Florida Blanca, and there, in presence of the French Ambassador,
he told me that the King had determined immediately
to receive the Envoy from the United States.
Our conversation was also very long, and I owe Count de
Montmorin the credit to say, that not only at that time, but
in every instance where he could operate on the Count de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Florida Blanca in our favor, he threw in all the weight of
the influence of France.</p>

<p>It was on Wednesday that I received Count de Florida
Blanca's visit. In conformity with the Spanish style, he
endeavored to delay our affairs. I took the liberty to say,
that on Saturday I must set out, and it was at last fixed
that on Friday, Mr Carmichael should deliver his credentials,
and on Saturday would be invited to the dinner of
the foreign Ministers.</p>

<p>As to more important matters, I conversed upon the
affair of limits, and upon the navigation of the Mississippi,
to the last of which points I found him very repugnant. I
spoke upon the codfish duties. I wanted to have a
preference engaged for in writing, upon all bargains respecting
tobacco and naval stores; in a word, I did my
best, and would have been more particular in point of
money, had not the Minister's answer put it out of my
power to do it in any other way, than such as was inconsistent
with the dignity of the United States.</p>

<p>As Count de Florida Blanca was taking leave, I told
him that my memory must be somewhat aided. I proposed
writing to him, and getting from him an answer.
To this he first objected, but afterwards consented, saying,
however, that his word was as good as his writing.
And as I had been sometimes a little high toned with him
in behalf of America, he added, that Spain was sincere in
her desire to form an everlasting friendship, but did not
act out of fear. I had before observed, that it was on
Spain's account that I wished for a good understanding
between her and America.</p>

<p>The reading of my letter, a copy of which I enclose,
will better inform you of the points that have been either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
wholly or partially granted. I endeavored to make the
best of our conversations, and to engage him as far as I
could. On the other hand, I kept our side clear of any
engagement, which it was easy for me to do in my private
capacity. I did not even go so far as general professions.
But since I had been called there, I desired only to induce
him into concessions that might serve the purposes of Mr
Jay. My letter was delivered on Thursday. The next
day I accompanied Mr Carmichael, who is much and universally
beloved and respected in that country. On Saturday,
before dinner, I received the answer, which for fear
of ambiguities, I had requested to be given at the end of
the letter. A sentence of the answer I made him explain
before the French Ambassador. Herein are joined those
copies, and I keep the original for Mr Jay, whose political
aid de camp I have thus been. I have of course referred
to him everything, and this negotiation, wherein he has
exercised the virtue of patience, will now require his care
and his abilities. The Ministers of some powers, Prussia
among them, having asked me if Congress would be willing
to make an advance towards them, I have answered,
that the United States ought in my opinion not to make,
but to receive advances.</p>

<p>At the same time I was employed in conversation with
Count de Florida Blanca, I did not neglect speaking upon
the same subject with the other Ministers. M. de Galvez,
in whose department the Indies are, appears much averse
to the English limit. He has for the present sent orders
to the Spanish governors, to abide by those limits, and an
official copy of those orders has been promised to me.
But M. de Galvez was of opinion, that those limits would
not do. I have therefore thought it proper, officially by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
writing, and before witnesses, so effectually to bind them,
that the affair of limits cannot now but be settled on their
side. Independent of their hand writing, France, through
her Ambassador, is a witness to the engagement; and yet,
being in a private capacity, I took care not to engage
America to anything.</p>

<p>Never was a man further from a partiality for Spain than
I am. But I think I now have left them in a sincere and
steady intention to cultivate the friendship of America.
The French party at that Court will be for it. They labor
under fits of occasional madness. They have an ill conducted
pride. It is disagreeable to treat with them, and
their own interest does not persuade them out of their
prejudices. But though they had rather there were not
such a place as North America, they are truly and earnestly
desirous to maintain a good harmony and live in
friendship and neighborly union with the United States.
The Mississippi is the great affair. I think it is the interest
of America to be well with Spain, at least for
many years; and particularly on account of the French
alliance; so that I very much wish success to Mr Jay's
negotiations. I have advised Mr Carmichael to continue
his conferences, and I think they will be of service.</p>

<p>On my arrival at this city, I hear that Lord Shelburne
is out of place, and has been succeeded by Lord North.
But I cannot give it as certain. The American flag has
already made its appearance before the city of London.</p>

<p>Upon the principles of an unbounded zeal for America,
can I be permitted to repeat, that every American patriot
must wish that the federal union between the States may
continue to receive additional strength? Upon that intimate
national union their happiness and their consequence
depend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>Hoping that my voluntary excursion to Madrid may
have somewhat prepared the way to fulfil the intentions of
Congress, I hasten to join Mr Jay, whose abilities will improve
the account I shall lay before him.</p>

<p class="indent1">I have the honor to be, with the most affectionate regard,

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, May 1st, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am now to acknowledge your favor of the 5th of February,
by the Triomphe, and that of the 2d of March,
from Bordeaux. You were the happy messenger of glad
tidings on both occasions. Before her arrival we had received
no account of the signature of the general preliminaries,
or of the cessation of hostilities. You can easily
conceive the joyful reception it met with here, where we
began to be heartily tired of the war; nor was it less welcome
intelligence to the army, than to the other citizens of
America.</p>

<p>The second letter, which promises a happy settlement
of all differences with Spain, was flattering to those among
us who knew the importance of her friendship, both in a
commercial and political view. Congress feel themselves
under great obligations to you, for the ardor you discovered
in accelerating this happy event; and the address
with which you placed it in such a train as to make it
difficult for the Spanish Minister to go back from his engagements.</p>

<p>By this conveyance I send our Ministers the ratification
of the provisional articles. Carleton and Digby have sent
out their prisoners, and we are making arrangements to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
send in ours. Congress having determined on their part
to do, not only all that good faith may require, but by this
mark of confidence to convince them, that they have no
doubt of the sincerity of their professions. Our Ministers
will show you the letters that have passed between Carleton
and me. Some among us, from finding nothing yet
done that leads to the evacuation of New York, have been
apprehensive that the British will effect delays on that subject,
till the tories are satisfied, which I can venture to tell
you in confidence they never will be unless the English shall
on their part repair all the cruel losses they have unnecessarily
occasioned. I this moment received a letter from the
General, informing me, that he had proposed a personal
interview with Carleton, in hopes of learning something of
his intentions with respect to the evacuation, but I fear he
will be deceived in this hope, if I may judge from the debates
of the 3d of March, which prove that no orders had
then been transmitted.</p>

<p>I cannot leave writing, without expressing how sincerely
I agree with you, in your wishes that unanimity may prevail,
and the band of union among us be strengthened;
there is no thinking man here, who does not at the same
time feel the necessity and lament the difficulty of effecting
a measure, on which our happiness so greatly depends.
Congress have made some general arrangements in their
finances, which if adopted by the several States, will render
our national debt a national tie, which time and experience
may strengthen. Our Ministers will show you
those resolutions; I will not therefore unnecessarily burden
Colonel Ogden with them. For general information
I refer you to him,</p>

<p class="indent1">And have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Chavaniac, in the Province of<br />
Auvergne, July 20th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Having been for some days in the country, where
I am waiting for the arrival of the <a name="Triomphe" id="Triomphe"></a>Triomphe I am honored
with your Excellency's favor of the 12th of April,
which I hasten to acknowledge. It is for me a great happiness
to think, that Congress have been pleased to approve
my conduct, and that an early intelligence has
proved useful to our American trade. To my great satisfaction
I also hear, that my endeavors in Spain have
been agreeable to Congress. Upon my arrival in Paris
I made Mr Jay acquainted with my proceedings. The
concessions I had obtained from the Spanish Court (without
any on our part) were also put into his hands. Since
which I could have no more to do in the negotiations,
wherein I had taken the part of a temporary volunteer.</p>

<p>However repeated may have been the marks of confidence,
which Congress have conferred upon me, they ever
fill my heart with a new satisfaction. What you have
mentioned respecting payment of debts, will of course become
my first and most interesting object. I have warmly
applied to the French Ministry, and will on that point solicit
the confidence of the gentlemen in the American
Commission. But upon hearing of an opportunity, I could
not an instant defer to acknowledge your Excellency's
letter. Agreeably to the last despatches, I am waiting for
the orders which I hope to receive by the Triomphe.
Any commands which Congress may have for me, shall
be cheerfully executed, by one of their earliest soldiers,
whose happiness it is to think, that at a less smiling moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
he had the honor to be adopted by America, and whose
blood, exertions, and affections, will in her good times, as
they have been in her worst, be entirely at her service.</p>

<p>It appears Russia is determined upon a Turkish war,
and should they give it up now, the matter would only be
postponed. What part the Emperor is to take, we cannot
at present so well determine. Whenever the way is opened
to me, I endeavor to do that which may prove agreeable
to Congress, and intend to keep them acquainted with
political occurrences. It is a pleasing idea for me now to
think, that nothing can derange our glorious state of
liberty and independence. Nothing, I say, for I hope
measures will be taken to consolidate the Federal Union,
and by those means to defeat European arts, and insure
eternal tranquillity.</p>

<p class="indent1">With the highest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signed">LAFAYETTE.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> Congress have no doubt received accurate
accounts respecting the affair of free ports. On my
arrival from Spain, I found that Bayonne and Dunkirk
had been pitched upon, and I immediately applied for
L'Orient and Marseilles. L'Orient is by far the most
convenient on the coast, and we now have got it.
That being done, I am again applying for Bayonne,
which has some advantages, and I wish Congress
would send orders to Mr Barclay. In the meanwhile,
the more free ports we have the better. This affair of
free ports, the subject which Congress have recommended,
and the despatches I am directed to expect
by the Triomphe, will determine the time when,
having no more American business here, I may indulge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
my ardent desire to return to the beloved shores
of America.</p>

<p class="signed">LAFAYETTE.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Nantes, September 7th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>In consequence of the late arrangements, the French
September packet is about to sail, and I beg your Excellency's
leave to improve that regular, speedy, and
safe opportunity. At the same time, Congress will
receive a definitive treaty. But upon this point, since
I left Madrid, my services have not been wanting.
From our Commissioners, Congress will of course
receive better information. This one object I must
however mention, which respects American debts.
As soon as I knew the wishes of Congress, I did, as I
ever shall in such a case, earnestly apply to the French
Ministry and the American Commissioners. But I
was answered that it could not be done, and did not
even consist with the powers of the British Ministry.
After which, and at that time of the negotiation, I had
no means to improve the hint I had received from
your Excellency.</p>

<p>As to mercantile affairs in France, Mr Barclay
will acquaint Congress with their present situation.
Bayonne and Dunkirk having been pointed out as
American free ports, and the opinion of Congress not
being known, I took upon myself to represent the
harbor of L'Orient as preferable to either of those
abovementioned. It has lately been made a free port;
and I now wish the affair of Bayonne may be again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
taken up. Those three ports, with Marseilles, would
make a very proper chain, and in the meanwhile, I
hope L'Orient will prove agreeable to the American
merchants.</p>

<p>There now exist in this kingdom many obstacles to
trade, which I hope, by little and little, will be eradicated,
and from the great national advantages of this
country over England, it will of course result that a
French trade, generally speaking, must prove more
beneficial to America. Upon many articles of American
produce I wish preference may be obtained from
this government, and besides commercial benefits in
Europe, your Excellency feels that West India arrangements
cannot easily be adjusted, with European
notions and at the present costs. Upon those objects,
Mr Barclay has had, and again will have, conferences
with the Ministers. Circumstanced as we now are, he
is, and the Commissioners also are of opinion, that
my presence in France may be serviceable. As he
was pleased to apply to me on the subject, saying he
would mention the matter to Congress, and as their
orders which I was to expect have not yet reached
me, I think it my present duty, and it ever shall be
my rule, to do that in which I hope to serve the
United States.</p>

<p>Warlike preparations are still going on in the eastward.
Immediately after she had signed a commercial
treaty with the Turks, it pleased the Empress of
Russia to seize upon the Crimea under a frivolous
pretence. Her armies are ready to take the field,
stores and troops have been collected upon the borders
of the Black Sea, and the Turks are making immense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
but I think not very formidable, preparations. By
our last accounts the Austrians were gathering upon
those borders, which lead towards an invasion of
Turkish Provinces; and it is thought by many, that
for fear of the plague, the two Imperial powers will
prefer winter operations. How far matters may be
carried, or compromised, cannot yet be well determined.
What part France, Prussia, and England will
take, is not yet known. The Levant trade cannot but
be interested in the affair.</p>

<p>In every American concern, Sir, my motives are so
pure, my sentiments so candid, my attachments so
warm and so long experienced, that from me nothing,
I hope, will appear intruding or improper. Upon
many points lately debated, my opinions, if worth a
remark, are well and generally known. But I must
frankly add, that the effect which some late transactions
have upon European minds cannot but make me
uneasy. In the difficulties, which a patriotic and deserving
army have met with, Europeans have been
misled to conceive a want of public gratitude. In the
opinions that have from every quarter been stated,
Europeans have also mistaken partial notions for a
want of disposition to the Federal Union; and, without
that Union, Sir, the United States cannot preserve
that dignity, that vigor, that power, which insures the
glory and the happiness of a great, liberal, and independent
nation. Nay, it would be ill fate to us, who
have worked, fought, and bled in this cause, to see the
United States a prey to the snares of European politics.
But I am only mentioning the opinions of men
on this side of the water, and in my heart, I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
everything will be adjusted to the satisfaction of that
part of the citizens, who have served in the army, and
that other part in the civil line, who, during the war,
have sympathised with their troops. I, above every
other earthly wish, most fervently pray, that the enemies
of liberty, or such as are jealous of America, may
not have the pleasure to see us deviate from the principles
of the Federal Union. And upon a recollection
of my introductory apology, I hope the observations I
humbly offer will be as kindly received, as they are
respectfully and affectionately presented.</p>

<p>When it is thought my presence here can be dispensed
with, or in case the situation of affairs should persuade me
it were more useful in America, I will not delay to join a

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, December 26th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Having received no commands from Congress by the
last packet, I must, however, trespass upon their time to
give them a few hints respecting American commerce. I
have of course directed them to Mr Morris; and although
Dr Franklin (the other Ministers being in England) will
give you political intelligence, I cannot help adding, that by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a refined piece of cunning, the King of England has got
Mr Fox out of the Ministry. After having entangled him
by a success in the House of Commons, he found means
to stop him short in the House of Lords; in consequence
of which Mr Fox has been dismissed. Mr Pitt, and the
last of the Temples called in, and the new administration,
(Lord North being also out) necessitates the calling of a
new Parliament.</p>

<p>The affairs between Russia and the Ottoman Empire
are still negotiating, and although in my opinion a war cannot
be much deferred in that quarter, there is no probability
of its taking place so soon as next summer. The
Emperor is in Italy, upon which some say he has also got
an eye, and there he will meet with the King of Sweden.
There is no change in the French Ministry, since M. de
Calonne has succeeded to M. de Omillon, and Baron de
Breteuil to M. Amelot, both of whom are more sensible
than their predecessors.</p>

<p>Unless I have some commands from Congress to execute
in Europe, I shall in the Spring embark for America,
and present them with the personal homage of one, whose
happiness is to feel himself forever a zealous member in
the service of the United States.</p>

<p class="letter_head">Mount Vernon, November 25th, 1784.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Although I hope in a few days to have the pleasure of
seeing you, I must beg leave to mention a matter, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
has not a little hurt my feelings. You probably know that
on my way, passing through New York, and particularly
on my visit to Albany, it was intimated my presence at the
Indian treaty would be of some use to the public. At
Fort Schuyler I was desired to speak to the Indians, which
I did, and the Commissioners had the papers filled up with
their other transactions. But copies were taken, which
was thought then a matter of no consequence. The enclosed
letter from Mr St John, and the gazette that accompanied
it, will show you that from the most obliging and
humble motives in the world, he attempted to translate and
print such incorrect parts of the relation as he had been
able to come at. Had his kind intentions only given him
an instant to reflect, he might have seen the impropriety of
that measure, but in the meanwhile, it looks as if it had my
consent; and such deviation is it from the manner in which
our servants of the United States ever did business, that
out of respect for Congress, for the Commissioners, and
myself, I could not rest easy until the matter should be
fully explained. Enclosed in my letter to the French
Consul, which, after you have taken out such extracts as
you think proper, I beg you will seal up and send by the
bearer. Indeed, my Dear Sir, upon your friendship I depend
to have this little circumstance officially laid before
Congress, and should these letters be worth their reading,
it will be, I hope, a satisfactory explanation of the affair.</p>

<p>In the first days of next month I shall have the pleasure
to meet you at Trenton, and at that time will have the opportunity
of conversing with you on several subjects. No
answer from you ever came to hand.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Versailles, February 8th, 1785.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>After thirty days passage, I was safely landed at Brest,
and am so lately arrived in Paris, that I had better refer
you to your Ministerial intelligence. In consequence of
Austrian demands upon the Dutch, and the gun these
have fired at &mdash;&mdash; forty thousand men were sent
to the Low Countries by the Emperor, and a second division
was in motion the same way, when France gave
orders for two armies to be got in readiness, the one,
probably, in Flanders, and the other in Alsace. Holland
is gathering some troops, the greater number purchased in
Germany, and will have at the utmost, thirty thousand
men in the field. Count de Maillebois, an old and able
French General, has been demanded by them. Russia
seems friendly to the Emperor; and although the Stadtholder
is a friend to the King of Prussia, while the patriots
are wholly attached to France, yet Prussia will, no
doubt, side in politics with France, and the Stadtholder
will command his own country's troops.</p>

<p>A grand plan is spoken of, whereby the Emperor would
endeavor to obtain Bavaria, and in return, give the Low
Countries to the Palatine House; a bargain, which
betters and increases the Imperial forces. Under these
circumstances, negotiations cannot but be very interesting.
Although the freedom of Holland, and the protection of
the German Princes, are very proper objects for France
to support, yet a war with the Emperor must be peculiarly
disagreeable to the Court. It will certainly be avoided,
if consistent with the liberties of Holland, with faith, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
dignity; and, upon the whole, I am strongly of opinion,
that no war will take place, at least for this year. The
appearance of things, however, is still warlike enough to
have made it proper for me to be arrived at the time I
did; an idea, I confess, the more necessary for the situation
of my mind, as I most heartily lamented the shortness
of this visit to America, and the obligation I had been
under to give up favorite plans, and break off more agreeable
arrangements. The officers of the regiments under
marching orders, Colonels excepted, have joined their
corps. But I hope matters will be compromised; and
such at least is my private opinion; but even they, who
know more than I do on the subject, would, perhaps, find
it difficult to form a precise one.</p>

<p>The Ministers of Congress will, no doubt, inform you of
the situation of their negotiations in Europe. You will
have seen M. de Castine's compliance with engagements.
He had taken a letter to me, which Mr Morris laid before
Congress. Nothing new was granted, and although the
suspended decisions about flour and sugars were favorable
to them, the French merchants have complained of what
has been obtained. In every country, mercantile prejudices
wear off by little and little.</p>

<p>I beg, my Dear Sir, you will forgive the hurry in which
I write. Be pleased to remember me to all our friends.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, March 19th, 1785.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have been honored with your letter of January the
19th, and am happy to hear that federal ideas are thriving
in America. The more I see, hear, and think in Europe,
the more I wish for every measure that can ensure to the
United States, dignity, power, and public confidence.
Your three Ministers being in Paris, they will, of course,
acquaint you with the present state of America, and also
of European politics. Great Britain perseveres in her ill-humor.
Spain in her ill-understood policy. On my arrival,
I repeated what I had written; namely, the idea
of getting New Orleans, or at least to advise the Spaniards
to make it a free port. The former is impossible.
As to the second, I had no positive answer, but I am
sure my opinion was not thrown away. However, I confess
it is difficult to make converts of a Spanish cabinet.
You know them better than I do.</p>

<p>Negotiations in Europe are still going on, and there
is every reason to hope this will be terminated without
bloodshed. Enclosed you will find a declaration, which
has been published officially in some measure, in the Leyden
Gazette. Count de Maillebois is now in Holland,
where they are raising troops, and where parties run very
high. In the meanwhile, the Emperor had another plan
in view, of which I wrote to you in my last letters; it was
to exchange his dominions in the Low Countries for the
Electorate of Bavaria. But, fortunately for all the members
of the empire, the Duke of Deux Ponts, nephew
and heir to the Elector, has firmly opposed it. A report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
had been spread, that the Emperor had intended to surprise
Maestricht. But although matters are not yet finally
settled, I am pretty certain there will not be this year
any Dutch war, nor Bavarian war, both of which could
not fail to involve France. It is, however, difficult to be
decided in an opinion upon a matter, which the ideas of
one man may derange.</p>

<p>You speak to me of the introduction of flour in the
West Indies. My wishes and my efforts are not unknown
to you. But such clamors have been raised by the
merchants against what we lately have obtained, that our
efforts now, must be directed towards holding it fast.
Those people are encouraged by the narrow politics of
England, who, say they, have all the trade of America. I
have appointed a conference with the Duc de la Vauguyon,
who is setting out for Spain, and I will tell him
everything I know respecting the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Your Ministers will, probably, write to you respecting
the Algerine business. What information I can collect
will be presented to them.</p>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, May 11th, 1785.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>This opportunity being very safe, Congress will have
been fully informed by their Minister and the bearer, Mr
John Adams's son, who is himself very well fit to give
them proper intelligence.</p>

<p>The appearances of a war are more and more remote.
Politicians do, however, look towards the Ottoman Empire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The Emperor is restless. The Empress of Russia is ambitious;
the King of Prussia is old; a King of the Romans
is to be elected; an arrangement for Bavaria, a reason or
a pretence, an interest or a whim might set fire to combustible
matters; but it is not expected for the present.</p>

<p>As it seems to me that favors granted to American importations
are one of the best services that can be rendered
to American trade, I wish it had been possible to obtain a
total abolition of duties upon whale oil. But in this moment
government are taken up with a scheme to revive
that fishery in France. It was therefore necessary to
follow a round about course, and Mr Adams is charged
with some private proposals, which may be advantageous.</p>

<p>In a few days I intend visiting Nismes, Montpellier, and
Rochelle, which are manufacturing and trading towns. I
hope my little journey may not be quite useless; after
which I shall go to Berlin and Silesia, to Vienna and Bohemia,
where the King of Prussia, and the Emperor, at
several periods of the summer, have grand man&oelig;uvres executed
by their troops. Should I in those visits find the
least opportunity to gratify my zeal for the United States,
I should think myself more happy than I can expect, and
as much so as your patriotic heart can feel.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, February 11th, 1786.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have not for a long time had the honor to address
you, either in public or private letters. This has been
owing to a tour I made through several parts of Europe,
and to a derangement in the packets, which, to my great
concern, I found to have taken place during my absence.</p>

<p>In the course of a journey to Prussia, Silesia, the Austrian
dominions, and back again to Berlin, I could not but
have many opportunities to improve myself by the inspection
of famous fields of battle, the conversation of the
greatest Generals, and the sight of excellent troops; those
of Prussia particularly exceeding my expectations. I had
occasions not less numerous to lament the folly of nations,
who can bear a despotic government, and to pay a new
tribute of respect and attachment to the constitutional principles
we had the happiness to establish. Wherever I
went, America was of course a topic in the conversation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Her efforts during the contest are universally admired;
and in the transactions, which have so gloriously taken
place, there is a large field of enthusiasm for the soldier, of
wonder and applause for the politician; and to the philosopher,
and the philanthropist, they are a matter of unspeakable
delight, and I could say of admiration. Those
sentiments I had the pleasure to find generally diffused.
But to my great sorrow, (and I will the more candidly tell
it in this letter, as it can hurt none more than it hurts myself,)
I did not find that every remark equally turned to the
advantage of my pride, and of that satisfaction I feel in the
admiration of the world for the United States.</p>

<p>In countries so far distant, under constitutions so foreign
to republican notions, the affairs of America cannot be
thoroughly understood, and such inconveniences as we
lament ourselves are greatly exaggerated by her enemies.
It would require almost a volume to relate how many mistaken
ideas I had the opportunity to set to rights. And it
has been painful for me to hear, it is now disagreeable to
mention, the bad effect which the want of federal union,
and of effective arrangements for the finances and commerce
of a general establishment of militia have had on the
minds of European nations. It is foolishly thought by
some, that democratical constitutions will not, cannot, last,
that the States will quarrel with each other, that a King,
or at least a nobility, are indispensable for the prosperity
of a nation. But I would not attend to those absurdities,
as they are answered by the smallest particle of unprejudiced
common sense, and will, I trust, be forever destroyed
by the example of America. But it was impossible for
me to feel so much unconcerned, when those points were
insisted upon, for which I could not but acknowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
within myself there was some ground; although it was so
unfairly broached upon by the enemies of the United
States. It is an object with the European governments to
check and discourage the spirit of emigration, which, I
hope, will increase among the Germans, with a more perfect
knowledge of the situation of America. And while I
was enjoying the admiration and respect of those parts of
the world for the character of the United States; while I
was obliged to hear some remarks, which, although they
were exaggerated, did not seem to me quite destitute of a
foundation, I heartily addressed my prayers to heaven,
that by her known wisdom, patriotism, and liberality of
principles, as well as firmness of conduct, America may
preserve the consequence she has so well acquired, and
continue to command the admiration of the world.</p>

<p>What I now have the honor to write, is the result of
conversations with the principal characters in the countries
I have visited; and particularly the Austrian and Prussian
Ministers, the Emperor, Duke of Brunswick, Prince
Henry, a man equally great and virtuous, the Prince
Royal, and the King of Prussia. With the last I have
often dined in the company of the Duke of York, second
son to his Britannic Majesty, when American affairs past
and present were brought on the carpet, and sometimes
in a manner not a little embarrassing for an English Prince.
My stay at Vienna was short, but I had a very long conference
with the Emperor, in which we spoke much of
the American trade, and I found he had imbibed British
prejudices. The next day Prince de Kaunitz introduced
the same subject to me, and expressed some astonishment,
that the United States did not make advances towards the
Emperor. I answered, advances had been made formerly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and more than were necessary on the part of America,
whom there was as much occasion to court, as for her to
seek for alliances. But that my attachment to his Imperial
Majesty made me wish he would address, on that business,
the Ministers of Congress, now at Paris and London,
through the medium of his Ambassadors. I added, that
the best measure to be taken immediately, was to open
the Italian ports to American fish. But I do not think the
United States will ever find a very extensive commercial
benefit in her treaties with that Court.</p>

<p>In everything that concerns France, my respected friend
Mr Jefferson will give you sufficient information. The
affair of American commerce wears a better prospect than
it has hitherto done; so far at least, that a committee has
been appointed to hear what we have to say on the trade
between this kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia is very unwell, and cannot live
many months. His nephew is an honest, firm, military
man. From the Emperor's temper a war could be feared.
But our system is so pacific, and it will be so difficult for
England to involve us in a quarrel without acting a part
which she has no interest to do, that I do not think the tranquillity
of Europe will he deranged. Holland is checking
Stadtholderian influence, but no further. The King of
Naples and his father are quarrelling on account of a Minister,
leaning to the House of Bourbon, and devoted to
other powers, whom the son wants to keep. I had lately
an opportunity to know, that the last revolt in Peru has
lost a hundred thousand lives; but from the same account
I find that those people are far remote from the ideas
which lead to a sensible revolution.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, October 28th, 1786.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Owing to several circumstances, and particularly to a
journey I have made through some garrison towns, your
favor of June the 16th has reached me very late. That
there should remain the least doubt with M. Gardoqui respecting
the adoption of the English limits, is a matter of
amazement to me. The original letter having been sent
I herewith enclose a copy, with a few observations. I
think its presentation to M. Gardoqui will the better convince
him, as he knows Count de Florida Blanca's respect
for his own word of honor. And may I be allowed to
add, that the more this letter is known, the better it will
impress the public with ideas favorable to the Spaniards,
and the Spaniards, with a sense of engagements, which
men of honor cannot trifle with.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>As to the navigation of the Mississippi, you know better
than I what are the strong prejudices of that Court against
it. But we both know equally well, that in a little time
we must have the navigation one way or other, which I
hope Spain may at last understand.</p>

<p>It has been said in some newspapers, that the Floridas
should be given up to France. But nothing has come to
our knowledge, which gives the least ground for an idea
of that kind. As Mr Jefferson sends you a letter relative
to commerce, which improves the condition of the treaty
with England, whereby she has no claims on the favors
enjoyed by the United States, although she is to be treated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
like the other most favored nations, and as M. Dumas is
writing on Dutch affairs, I will only beg leave to inform
you, that the appointment of the convention has had
already a good effect in Europe, and that great benefit will
be derived on this side of the water also, from the commercial
and federal measures, which it is my happiness to
hear are now under consideration.</p>

<p>Although there may be a diversity of opinions, whether
a peace must be purchased at any rate from the Barbary
Powers, or a war must be carried on against them until
they come to proper terms, there can in no mind be any
doubt about the advantages of a third measure, which is a
confederacy of six or seven powers, each of them giving
a small quota, and the reunion of which would ensure a
constant and sufficient cruise against those pirates, and
after they are brought to terms, would guard against the
breaking of a peace which the powers would mutually
guarranty to each other. Portugal, Tuscany, Naples,
Venice, and Genoa, are now at war with those regencies.
I would like at the same time to have the armament so
managed as to use American flour, fish, and naval stores.
This plan is not as yet very well digested in my head, but
I beg leave to submit to Congress the propriety of impowering
their Ministers to stipulate for such an arrangement.</p>

<p class="indent1">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> In case Congress have no particular orders for
me, (in which case I should be most happy to wait on
them, either as a soldier in their armies, or in any other
manner) I may perhaps accept the invitation of the Empress
of Russia, to be presented to her next spring in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
new dominions of Crimea, which excite my curiosity.
Should anything turn out that may employ me as a servant
of the United States, I hope they know my zeal.</p>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, February 7th, 1787.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>This letter goes in the first packet from Havre, a change
advantageous both to passengers and correspondents, and
through the hands of Colonel Franks, whose good conduct
at Morocco has entitled him to a share of that respect,
which has been deservedly paid to the American Embassy.
Mr Barclay's refusal of the presents has been a
matter of wonder to every African, and I dare say to
some Europeans, whose accounts do full justice to him.</p>

<p>To Mr Jefferson's despatches I refer for useful intelligence.
The affairs of Holland do not make a progress
towards conciliation. It seems that the King of
Prussia will not find himself the better for counteracting
in many points, the line of conduct of his deceased uncle.
A treaty of commerce is signed between France and Russia.
The Empress has set out on her journey towards
Crimea. She had permitted my waiting on her, but I am
detained by the Assembly of Notables, an event not very
common, neither expected, which does honor to the King
and his Ministry, and will, I trust, be productive of public
good.</p>

<p>I have had the honor to send copies of my old correspondence
with the Count de Florida Blanca. The enclosed
one will supply any accident that may have befallen
the others. We are told, that the unhappy disturbances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in New England have subsided. To us they do not appear
so dangerous as to Europeans; but sufficiently so to
give us a great deal of concern. May all Americans know
the blessings of their own constitutions, and from comparison
judge, that if they are to correct, it would be madness
in them to destroy.</p>

<p>I hope the convention at Philadelphia will answer the
essential and urgent purposes of the confederation, commerce,
and the establishment of a uniform and republican
militia. Each State has within itself the means fully sufficient
to set right the opinions of mistaken citizens, and
those means seem to me principally founded on the good
sense, knowledge, and patriotic liberality of the people.
Every wrong measure of theirs would hurt, not only the
consequence of the United States, but also the cause of
liberty in all parts of the world.</p>

of the latter part of our session, but have only
time to enclose the speeches that were made by the
heads of the several departments. Not that such

wherein he gives the King's answer to the several demands

that will come to light as we go on; economies to the
amount of forty millions at least; the destruction of
interior custom houses; a modification of the Gabelle;
an annual publication of the account of the finances;
the printing of all pensions, gifts, &amp;c.; more proper
arrangements within some departments; and a more
general instruction, habit of thinking on public affairs,
&amp;c. &amp;c. are the good effects of this Assembly, which,
although it was not national, since we were not representatives,
behaved with great propriety and patriotism.</p>

<p>On the last day of our session, I had the happiness
to carry two motions in my Bureau which were, I
may almost say, unanimously agreed to; the one in
favor of the Protestant citizens of France, the other
for an examination of the laws, particularly the criminal
ones. Enclosed is the resolve framed by the Bureau,
which Count D'Artois, our President, presented
to the King, and was graciously received. I was the
more pleased with it, as some step of the kind, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
respect to the protestants, that had been tried in the
Parliament of Paris, had not the proper success. So
far are we from religious freedom, that even in asking
for tolerance, we must measure our expressions. I
was more liberally supported, by a learned and virtuous
prelate, the bishop of Langres, who spoke admirably
on the religious motion I had introduced. You
will see that the Bureau clogged it with many compliments
to the Roman creed, to appease the priests and
devotees.</p>

<p>I cannot express to you, my Dear Sir, what my
feelings have been, whenever the unpaid interest of
the American debt has been spoken of in the examination
of the accounts. May the convention be the
happy epocha of federal, energetic, patriotic measures!
May the friends of America rejoice! May her enemies
be humbled, and her censors silenced at the news
of her noble exertions in continuance of those principles,
which have placed her so high in the annals of
history, and among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Toulouse is the ablest, and one of
the most honest men, that could be put at the head of
administration. He will be the prime influencer in
everything, and we may depend upon him as a man
equally enlightened and liberal.</p>

<p>I beg you will present my respectful compliments
and those of Madame de Lafayette to Mrs Jay. Remember
me to General Knox, Colonel Hamilton,
Colonel Wadsworth, the Chancellor, Mr Madison,
Doctor Cochran, the Governor, in a word, to all
friends.</p>

<p>Please send the enclosed printed speeches, and

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, October 15th, 1787.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The present state of politics having been laid before
Congress, I shall the less intrude on their time with repetitions,
as the late transactions in Holland have nothing
pleasing to dwell upon. That the republican party have
been disunited in many respects, and blinded in the choice
of a General, that our cabinet have been treacherously deceived,
are true, but insufficient apologies. The Ottomans,
roused by England, will, probably, pay for their
folly with one half of their empire. It now lies with England,
whether a maritime war is to break out, which must
involve the continent, and connect France with the two
Imperial Courts. France is sincere in her politics and
moderate in her pretensions, as it is the ardent wish of the
King, Ministers, and nation, to devote themselves to internal
improvements. But the affairs of Holland, those in
the east, the giddiness of the King of Prussia's head, and
British rancor for the assistance given to America, are
causes of war, which, notwithstanding the disposition of
this Ministry, may, probably, be blown up in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>It is natural for a citizen and servant of the United
States to consider what effect a maritime war would have
upon them; and I am happy to find in their indulgence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and long experienced confidence, every encouragement to
offer my opinion.</p>

<p>A co-operation against a proud and rancorous enemy
would equally please my politics as a Frenchman, my
feelings as an American, my views as an individual. I
was nine years ago honored with the choice of Congress, to
command an army into Canada, and never have I ceased
to enjoy the prospect of its enfranchisement. A successful
war, too, might divide the fisheries between France and
America. But are not the United States so circumstanced
for the present, as to render a war too expensive
for them and too dangerous to their commerce?</p>

<p>Convinced as I am, that it is the case, I think myself
bound in duty and love for them, not to indulge my ambition
further than a neutrality useful to them and favorable
to their allies. Every American harbor will offer a
shelter for the French ships, a market for their prizes, and
all the conveniences of repair and victualling; all which
being consistent with treaties gives no ground of complaint.
Although the trade is going on between England and America,
it does not hinder the French Colonies from being
supplied with all their wants. Privateering itself, if under
French colors, does no harm; and so may the United
States enrich themselves with a free trade with both
nations, at the same time that they maintain their own
tranquillity and help their allies. And should they be
forced into a war, I would wish at least it was delayed as
long as possible, and postponed, for obvious reasons, to the
last campaign.</p>

<p>It is to be confessed, that France might lay some claims
on more decisive measures, but sensible as she is of the
unavoidable situation of affairs in America, I have reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
to believe she would not hurry her into a war, and will be
satisfied with such a friendly, helping neutrality.</p>

<p>But I consider the present time as a proper one to obtain
the restoration of the forts, and, perhaps, the navigation
of the Mississippi, two points, which I confess I could
never submit to the idea of giving up. The one is
ours<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> by the laws of nations, the other by the laws of
nature; and may I be permitted to add, that either concession
would be inconsistent with the character of the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr Jefferson gives an account of the measure taken
respecting the commerce between this kingdom and America.
I wish that affair had been terminated in time for the
departure of Count de Mourtier, a gentleman whose personal
character will, I trust, deserve the confidence and
approbation of Congress.</p>

<p>We are anxiously waiting for the result of the convention
at Philadelphia, as an event which, being engrafted in
the present dispositions of the people, will, probably, add a
lustre and a proper weight to the affairs of America in
Europe; and, while it ensures internal happiness and
prosperity, will baffle the insidious wishes, and annihilate
the absurd reports of her enemies.</p>

<p>The next month is the appointed time for the sessions
of all Provincial Assemblies, an establishment, which
will be productive of the best consequences.</p>

<p>The liberty I have taken in expressing my opinion on
an event not certain, but not improbable, cannot be referred,
I am sure, to any principles of vanity or self-sufficiency;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
but to the gratitude so well grounded, and the zeal,
which shall ever rank me among the most devoted servants
of the United States.</p>

<p>With every sentiment of personal attachment and regard,
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="section_break"></div>

<p>As early as September 27th, 1779, John Adams was
appointed by Congress Minister Plenipotentiary for negotiating
a treaty of peace and commerce with Great Britain,
whenever that power should be prepared to acknowledge
the independence of the United States, and enter into a
treaty. Mr Adams went to Europe on this mission, but as
no opportunity occurred for putting it into execution, he
received another appointment as Minister to Holland.</p>

<p>Meantime Congress, on the 14th of June, 1781, annulled
Mr Adams's first commission for negotiating a treaty, and
associated with him four other persons for this purpose,
namely, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens,
and Thomas Jefferson. To these five commissioners, or
to a majority of them, or any one of them alone, in case
accident prevented the presence of the others, was assigned
the power of making a treaty of peace with such commissioners,
as should be appointed for the same object on the
part of the English Court. Richard Oswald was the British
Commissioner. He went to Paris in the Spring of
1782, and commenced the negotiation with Dr Franklin,
who was then the only one of the American Commissioners
present. Mr Jay arrived in Paris from Spain on the
23d of June, and united with Dr Franklin in the labors of
the mission. As Mr Adams was then employed in completing
a treaty with Holland, he did not join his colleagues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
till near the end of October. The Provisional articles
were signed on the 30th of November. Mr Laurens was
present at the signature of the treaty, having arrived only
two days previous to that event. Mr Jefferson did not engage
in the mission.</p>

<p>Adams, Franklin, and Jay remained in Paris after the
signature of the preliminary articles, as Commissioners for
making a Definitive Treaty. The English government sent
David Hartley to Paris for the same purpose. Many propositions
passed between the Commissioners of the respective
countries, but after ten months' fruitless discussion, the
Definitive Treaty was signed in the exact words of the
Provisional Articles, on the 3d of September, 1783.</p>

<p>As the Commissioners corresponded singly with the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and the President of Congress,
during the whole period of the negotiation, they
wrote but few letters in concert. The records of the
Commissioners, kept by their Secretary, have also been
lost. Nearly all the papers, which have much value, have
been found and arranged for the present publication, but
there are yet some deficiencies. The history of the negotiation
can only be understood by reading carefully, in connexion
with these papers and letters, the correspondence
of each of the Commissioners during the same period.</p>

<h3>COMMISSION TO TREAT OF PEACE.</h3>

<p>The United States of America, in Congress assembled,
to all to whom these presents shall come, send greeting.</p>

<p>Whereas, these United States, from a sincere desire of
putting an end to the hostilities between his Most Christian
Majesty and these United States, on the one part, and his
Britannic Majesty on the other, and of terminating the
same by a peace founded on such solid and equitable principles
as reasonably to promise a permanency of the blessings
of tranquillity, did heretofore appoint the honorable
John Adams, late a Commissioner of the United States of
America at the Court of Versailles, late Delegate in Congress
from the State of Massachusetts, and Chief Justice
of the said State, their Minister Plenipotentiary, with full
powers, general and special, to act in that quality, to confer,
treat, agree, and conclude with the Ambassadors, or
Plenipotentiaries, of his Most Christian Majesty, and of his
Britannic Majesty, and those of any other Princes or States,
whom it might concern, relating to the re-establishment of
peace and friendship; and whereas, the flames of war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
have since that time been extended, and other nations and
States are involved therein,</p>

<p>Now know ye, that we, still continuing earnestly desirous,
as far as it depends upon us, to put a stop to the effusion
of blood, and to convince the powers of Europe, that
we wish for nothing more ardently, than to terminate the
war by a safe and honorable peace, have thought proper to
renew the powers formerly given to the said John Adams,
and to join four other persons in commission with him, and
having full confidence in the integrity, prudence, and ability
of the honorable Benjamin Franklin, our Minister Plenipotentiary
at the Court of Versailles, and the honorable John
Jay, late President of Congress, and Chief Justice of the
State of New York, and our Minister Plenipotentiary at
the Court of Madrid, and the honorable Henry Laurens,
formerly President of Congress, and commissioned and
sent as our Agent to the United Provinces of the Low
Countries, and the honorable Thomas Jefferson, Governor
of the Commonwealth of Virginia, have nominated, constituted,
and appointed, and by these presents do nominate,
constitute, and appoint, the said Benjamin Franklin, John
Jay, Henry Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson, in addition to
the said John Adams, giving and granting to them, the said
John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens,
and Thomas Jefferson, or the majority of them, or of
such of them as may assemble, or, in the case of the death,
absence, indisposition, or other impediment of the others,
to any one of them, full power and authority, general and
special, conjunctly and separately, and general and special
command to repair to such place as may be fixed upon for
opening negotiations for peace, and there for us, and in our
name, to confer, treat, agree, and conclude with the Ambassadors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Commissioners, and Plenipotentiaries of the
Princes and States, whom it may concern, vested with
equal powers relating to the establishment of peace, and
whatsoever shall be agreed and concluded for us, and in
our name to sign and thereupon make a treaty or treaties,
and to transact everything, that may be necessary for completing,
securing, and strengthening the great work of pacification,
in as ample form, and with the same effect, as if
we were personally present and acted therein, hereby promising
in good faith, that we will accept, ratify, fulfil and
execute whatever shall he agreed, concluded, and signed
by our said Ministers Plenipotentiary, or a majority of
them, or of such of them as may assemble, or, in case of
the death, absence, indisposition, or other impediment of
the others, by any one of them; and that we will never
act, nor suffer any person to act, contrary to the same, in
whole or in any part.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, we have caused these presents to be
signed by our President, and sealed with his seal.</p>

<p>Done at Philadelphia, the fifteenth day of June, in the
year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eightyone,

beloved friend and ally, has informed us by his Minister
Plenipotentiary, whom he has appointed to reside near us,

the Emperor of Germany, actuated by sentiments of
humanity, and a desire to put a stop to the calamities of
war, have offered their mediation to the belligerent powers,

as far as depends upon us, to put a stop to the effusion of
blood, and convince all the powers of Europe that we
wish for nothing more ardently than to terminate this war

Plenipotentiary in behalf of the United States, to negotiate
a treaty of peace.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>You are hereby authorised and instructed to concur, in
behalf of these United States, with his Most Christian
Majesty, in accepting the mediation proposed by the Empress
of Russia and the Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>You are to accede to no treaty of peace, which shall
not be such as may 1st, effectually secure the independence
and sovereignty of the Thirteen United States, according
to the form and effect of the treaties subsisting
between the said United States and his Most Christian
Majesty; and 2dly, in which the said treaties shall not be
left in their full force and validity.</p>

<p>As to disputed boundaries, and other particulars, we refer
you to the instructions given to Mr John Adams, dated
14th of August, 1779, and 18th of October, 1780,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> from
which you will easily perceive the desires and expectations

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
tie you up by absolute and peremptory directions upon any
other subject, than the two essential articles above mentioned.
You are therefore at liberty to secure the interest
of the United States, in such manner as circumstances may
direct, and as the state of the belligerent, and the disposition
of the mediating powers may require. For this purpose,
you are to make the most candid and confidential communications
upon all subjects to the Ministers of our generous
ally, the King of France; to undertake nothing in the negotiations
for peace or truce, without their knowledge and
concurrence; and ultimately to govern yourselves by their
advice and opinion, endeavoring in your whole conduct to
make them sensible how much we rely upon his Majesty's
influence for effectual aid in everything that may be necessary
to the peace, security, and future prosperity of the
United States of America.</p>

<p>If a difficulty should arise, in the course of the negotiation
for peace, from the backwardness of Great Britain to
acknowledge our independence, you are at liberty to agree
to a truce, or to make such other concessions as may not
affect the substance of what we contend for; and provided
that Great Britain be not left in possession of any part of
the United States.</p>

Greeting. Whereas, by virtue of an Act passed in the
last session of Parliament, entitled "An Act to enable
his Majesty to conclude a peace or truce with certain
colonies in North America therein mentioned," it is recited,
'that it is essential to the interest, welfare and
prosperity of Great Britain and the Colonies or Plantations
of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
the three lower counties on Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia
in North America, that peace, intercourse, trade and
commerce should be restored between them;' Therefore,
and for a full manifestation of our earnest wish
and desire, and of that of our Parliament, to put an
end to the calamities of war, it is enacted, that it
should and might be lawful for us to treat, consult of,
agree and conclude, with any Commissioner or Commissioners,

<h3>COMMISSION TO WILLIAM T. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p>To all to whom these Presents shall come, Benjamin

<p>Whereas the United States of America, in Congress assembled,

were, authorised to appoint a Secretary to their commission,
and that he be entitled to receive, in proportion to
his time of service, the salary of one thousand pounds
sterling per annum allowed to Mr Dana. And whereas his
Britannic Majesty has issued a commission, dated the
21st of September, 1782, to Richard Oswald, to treat of,
and conclude peace with any Commissioners, or persons
vested with equal powers, by, and on the part of the

<h3>RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, October 3d, 1782.</p>

<p>On report of a Committee, to whom were referred
notes of a conference with the Minister of France, held
by a Committee of Congress on the 24th of September
last;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Most
Christian Majesty be informed;</p>

<p>That the communication, made by the said Minister on
the 24th of September last, is considered by Congress as
an additional proof of his Majesty's magnanimity, and has
confirmed those sentiments of affection and confidence,
which his wise, steady, and liberal conduct in every stage
of the war had so justly inspired;</p>

<p>That his Most Christian Majesty's declaration to the
British Minister at Paris, that he will neither treat, nor terminate
any negotiation, unless the interests of his allies and
friends shall be considered and determined, is entirely correspondent
to the part, which these United States are resolved
to take in any negotiations for peace;</p>

<p>That Congress, with the utmost satisfaction, embrace
this opportunity to renew their assurances, that, in every
event, the United States will inviolably adhere to their alliance
with his Most Christian Majesty, which they consider
to be equally essential to their interest and their
glory;</p>

<p>That they will hearken to no propositions for peace,
which shall not be discussed in confidence and in concert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
with his Most Christian Majesty, agreeably to the declaration
made to the Minister Plenipotentiary on the 31st day
of May last;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>That upon this principle, Congress did not hesitate a
moment to reject the proposition made by the British General
and Admiral, as Commissioners of peace, for admitting
Mr Morgan, their Secretary, to an interview at Philadelphia;</p>

<p>And that they are resolved to prosecute the war with
vigor, until a general peace shall be obtained, in which
their allies shall be comprehended;</p>

<p>That Congress placed the utmost confidence in his
Majesty's assurances, that he will readily employ his good
offices in support of the United States, in all points relative
to their prosperity; and considering the territorial claims
of these States, as heretofore made, their participation of
the fisheries and of the free navigation of the Mississippi,
not only as their indubitable right, but as essential to their
prosperity, they trust, that his Majesty's efforts will be successfully
employed to obtain a sufficient provision and security
for those rights. Nor can they refrain from making
known to his Majesty, that any claim of restitution, or
compensation for property confiscated in the several
States, will meet with insuperable obstacles; not only on
account of the sovereignty of the individual States, by
which such confiscations have been made, but of the wanton
devastations, which the citizens of these States have
experienced from the enemy, and, in many instances, from
the very persons in whose favor such claim may be urged;</p>

<p>That Congress trust that the circumstances of the allies,
at the negotiation for peace, will be so prosperous as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
render these expectations consistent with the spirit of moderation
recommended by his Majesty.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the Committee, who brought in the
report, communicate to the honorable Minister of France
the above answer of Congress to his communications.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs transmit,
by the first opportunity, a copy of the same to the
Ministers of these States at foreign Courts.</p>

<h3>ARTICLES AGREED ON BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AND
BRITISH COMMISSIONERS.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h3>

<p class="letter_head">October 8th, 1782.</p>

<p>Articles agreed upon by and between Richard Oswald,
the Commissioner of his Britannic Majesty, for treating
of peace with the Commissioners of the United States of
America, on the behalf of his said Majesty on the one
part, and Benjamin Franklin and John Jay, of the Commissioners
of the said States, for treating of peace with the
Commissioner of his said Majesty on their behalf, on the
other part.</p>

<p>To be inserted in, and to constitute the treaty of peace,
proposed to be concluded between the Crown of Great
Britain and the said United States; but which treaty is not
to be concluded, until his Britannic Majesty shall have
agreed to the terms of peace between France and Britain,
proposed or accepted by his Most Christian Majesty; and
shall be ready to conclude with him such treaty accordingly.
It being the duty and intention of the United States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
not to desert their ally, but faithfully, and in all things to
abide by, and fulfil their engagements with his Most Christian
Majesty.</p>

<p>Whereas reciprocal advantages and mutual convenience
are found by experience, to form the only permanent foundation
of peace and friendship between States, it is agreed
to frame the articles of the proposed treaty, on such principles
of liberal equality and reciprocity, as that partial
advantages (those seeds of discord) being excluded, such
a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse between the two
countries may be established, as to promise and secure to
both the blessings of perpetual peace and harmony. 1st.
His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States
viz. New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island
and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to be free, sovereign
and independent States; that he treats with them as
such; and for himself, his heirs and successors, relinquishes
all claims to the government, propriety, and territorial rights
of the same, and every part thereof; and that all disputes
which might arise in future, on the subject of the boundaries
of the said United States, may be prevented, it is
hereby agreed and declared, that the following are, and
shall remain to be their boundaries, viz.</p>

<p>The said States are bounded north, by a line to be drawn
from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, along the high
lands, which divide those rivers which empty themselves
into the river St Lawrence, from those which fall into the
Atlantic ocean, to the northernmost head of Connecticut
river; thence down along the middle of that river to the
fortyfifth degree of north latitude, and thence due west in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the latitude fortyfive degrees north from the equator, to
the northwesternmost side of the river St Lawrence, or
Cadaraqui; thence straight to the south end of the lake
Nipissing, and thence straight to the source of the river
Mississippi, west by a line to be drawn along the middle of
the river Mississippi, from its source to where the said
line shall intersect the thirtyfirst degree of north latitude;
south by a line to be drawn due east from the termination
of the line last mentioned, in the latitude of thirtyone degrees
north of the equator to the middle of the river Apalachicola
or Catahouchi; thence along the middle thereof
to its junction with the Flint river; thence straight to the
head of St Mary's river; thence down along the middle
of St Mary's river to the Atlantic ocean; and east by a
line to be drawn along the middle of St John's river, from
its source to its mouth in the Bay of Fundy; comprehending
all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the
shores of the United States, and lying between lines to be
drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries,
between Nova Scotia, on the one part, and East
Florida on the other, shall respectively touch the Bay of
Fundy and the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>2dly. From and immediately after the conclusion of the
proposed treaty, there shall be a firm and perpetual peace
between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, and
between the subjects of the one and the citizens of the
other; wherefore all hostilities, both by sea and land, shall
then immediately cease; all prisoners on both sides shall be
set at liberty; and his Britannic Majesty shall forthwith, and
without causing any distinction, withdraw all his armies,
garrisons, and fleets, from the said United States, and from
every post, place, and harbor, within the same, leaving in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
all fortifications the American artillery that may be therein;
and shall also order and cause all archives, records, deeds,
and papers, belonging to either of the said States, or their
citizens, which in the course of the war, may have fallen
into the hands of his officers, to be forthwith restored, and
delivered to the proper States and persons to whom they
belong.</p>

<p>3dly. That the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and
people of the said United States, shall continue to enjoy
unmolested, the right to take fish of every kind on the
banks of Newfoundland, and other places where the inhabitants
of both countries used formerly, to wit, before
the last war between France and Britain, to fish and also
to dry and cure the same at the accustomed places,
whether belonging to his said Majesty or to the United
States; and his Britannic Majesty and the said United
States will extend equal privileges and hospitality to each
other's fishermen as to their own.</p>

<p>4thly. That the navigation of the river Mississippi, from
its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open,
and that both there, and in all rivers, harbors, lakes, ports,
and places, belonging to his Britannic Majesty or to the
United States, or in any part of the world, the merchants
and merchant ships, of the one and the other, shall be
received, treated, and protected, like the merchants and
merchant ships of the sovereign of the country. That is
to say, the British merchants and merchant ships, on the
one hand, shall enjoy in the United States, and in all places
belonging to them, the same protection and commercial
privileges, and be liable only to the same charges and
duties as their own merchants and merchant ships; and on
the other hand, the merchants and merchant ships of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
United States, shall enjoy in all places belonging to his
Britannic Majesty, the same protection and commercial
privileges and be liable only to the same charges and duties
of British merchants and merchant ships, saving always
to the chartered trading companies of Great Britain, such
exclusive use and trade, and their respective posts and
establishments, as neither the subjects of Great Britain,
nor any of the more favored nations participate in.</p>

<h3>RICHARD OSWALD TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, November 4th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>You may remember, that from the very beginning of
our negotiations for settling a peace between Great Britain
and America, I insisted that you should positively stipulate
for a restoration of the property of all those persons,
under the denomination of loyalists or refugees, who have
taken part with Great Britain in the present war; or if the
property had been resold and passed into such variety of
hands, as to render the restoration impracticable, (which
you asserted to be the case in many instances) you should
stipulate for a compensation or indemnification to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
persons, adequate to their losses. To these propositions
you said you could not accede. Mr Strachey, since his
arrival at Paris, has most strenuously joined me in insisting
upon the said restitution, compensation, or indemnification,
and in laying before you every argument in favor
of those demands, founded upon national honor, and upon
the true principles of justice. These demands you must
have understood to extend, not only to all persons of the
above mentioned description, who have fled to Europe,
but likewise to all those who may be now in any parts of
North America, dwelling under the protection of his Majesty's
arms or otherwise.</p>

<p>We have also insisted upon a mutual stipulation for a
general amnesty on both sides, comprehending thereby
an enlargement of all persons, who on account of offences,
committed or supposed to be committed, since the commencement
of hostilities, may be now in confinement; and
for an immediate repossession of their properties, and
peaceable enjoyment thereof, under the government of the
United States. To this you have not hitherto given a
particular or direct answer.</p>

<p>It is, however, incumbent on me, as Commissioner of
the King of Great Britain, to repeat those several demands;
and without going over those arguments upon paper,
(which we have so often urged in conversation,) to
press your immediate attention to these subjects, and to
urge you to enter into proper stipulations for the restitution,
compensation, and amnesty above mentioned, before
we proceed further in this negotiation.</p>

<p class="indent1">I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean, and along
the said highlands to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut
river, thence down along the middle of that river
to the 45th degree of north latitude, following the said latitude
until it strikes the river Mississippi; thence by a line,
to be drawn along the middle of the said river Mississippi,
until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the 31st degree
of latitude north of the equator; south, by a line to
be drawn due east from the termination of the line last
mentioned in the latitude of the 31st degree to the middle
of the river Apalachicola or Catahouchi, thence along the
middle thereof to its junction with the Flint river, thence
straight to the head of St Mary's river, and thence

aforesaid highlands, which divide the rivers which fall into
the Atlantic ocean from those which empty themselves
into the river St Lawrence, comprehending all islands
within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the
United States, and lying between lines to be drawn due
east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries of St
Croix river and St Mary's river shall respectively touch
the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>It is agreed, that all such royalists or refugees, as well as
all such British merchants or other subjects as may be resident
in any of the United States at the time of the evacuation
thereof by the arms and garrisons of his Britannic
Majesty, shall be allowed six months thereafter to remove
to any part of the world; and also, at their election, to
dispose of, within the said term, or to carry with them their
goods and effects. And it is understood, that the said
States shall extend such further favor to the said merchants,
and such amnesty and clemency to the said refugees, as
their respective circumstances and the dictates of justice
and humanity may render just and reasonable; and particularly,
that amnesty and indemnity be granted to all such
of the said refugees, as may be unaffected by acts, judgments,
or prosecutions, actually passed or commenced a
month previous to such evacuation.</p>

<p>That the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and the people
of the said United States, shall continue to enjoy unmolested,
the right to take fish of every kind on all the
Banks of Newfoundland, also in the Gulf of St Lawrence,
and all other places where the inhabitants of both countries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
used at any time heretofore to fish; and also to dry and
cure their fish on the shores of the Isle of Sables, Cape
Sables, and the shores of any of the unsettled bays, harbors
or creeks of Nova Scotia, and of the Magdalen
Islands. And his Britannic Majesty and the said United
States will extend equal privileges and hospitality to each
other's fishermen as to their own.</p>

<p>Whereas certain of the United States, excited thereto
by the unnecessary destruction of private property, have
confiscated all debts due from their citizens to British subjects;
and also in certain instances, lands belonging to the
latter; and whereas, it is just that private contracts made
between individuals of the two countries before the war,
should be faithfully executed; and as the confiscation of
the said lands may have a latitude not justifiable by the
law of nations, it is agreed, that British creditors shall, notwithstanding,
meet with no lawful impediment to recovering
the full value or sterling amount of such <i>bona fide</i> debts
as were contracted before the year 1775. And also, that
Congress will recommend to the said States, so to correct
(if necessary) their said acts respecting the confiscation of
the lands in America, belonging to real British subjects, as
to render the said acts consistent with perfect justice and
equity. As to the cession made of certain lands in Georgia,
by a number of Indians there, on the 1st of June,
1773, for the purpose of paying the debts due from them
to a number of traders, the American Commissioners
say, that the State of Georgia is alone competent to consider
and decide on the same; for that it being a matter of
internal police, with which neither Congress nor their Commissioners
are authorised to interfere, it must of necessity
be referred to the discretion and justice of that State, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
without doubt, will be disposed to do what may be just and
reasonable on the subject.</p>

<p>Similar reasons and considerations constrain the Commissioners
to give the like answer to the case of Mr Penn's
family.</p>

<p>From and immediately after the conclusion of the proposed
treaty, there shall be a perpetual and firm peace,
&amp;c. (the same as the second article in the preceding set of
articles.)</p>

<p>That the navigation of the river Mississippi from its
source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Separate Article.</span> It is hereby understood and
agreed, that in case Great Britain at the conclusion of the
present war shall be, or be put in possession of West Florida,
the line of north boundary between the said Province
and the United States, shall be a line drawn from the
mouth of the river Yazoo, where it unites with the Mississippi,
due east to the river Apalachicola, and thence along
the middle of that river to its junction with the Flint
river, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>H. STRACHEY TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, November 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Knowing the expectation of the King's Ministers, that a
full indemnity shall be provided for the whole body of refugees,
either by a restitution of their property or by some
stipulated compensation for their losses, and being confident,
as I have repeatedly assured you, that your refusal
upon this point will be the great obstacle to a conclusion
and ratification of that peace, which is meant as a solid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
perfect, permanent reconciliation and reunion between
Great Britain and America, I am unwilling to leave Paris
without once more submitting the matter to your consideration.
It affects equally, in my opinion, the honor and the
humanity of your country and of ours. How far you will
be justified in risking every favorite object of America,
by contending against those principles, is for you to determine.
Independence, and more than a reasonable possession
of territory, seem to be within your reach. Will you
suffer them to be outweighed by the gratification of resentment
against individuals? I venture to assert, that such a
conduct has no parallel in the history of civilized nations.</p>

<p>I am under the necessity of setting out by two o'clock
today; if the time is too short for your reconsideration, and
final determination of this important point, I shall hope that
you will enable Mr Oswald to despatch a messenger after
me, who may be with me before morning at Chantilly,
where I propose sleeping tonight, or who may overtake
me before I arrive in London, with a satisfactory answer
to this letter.</p>

<p class="indent1">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, November 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>In answer to the letter you did us the honor to write on
the 4th instant, we beg leave to repeat what we often
said in conversation, viz; that the restoration of such of
the estates of refugees as have been confiscated is impracticable,
because they were confiscated by laws of particular
States, and in many instances have passed by legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
titles through several hands. Besides, Sir, as this is a
matter evidently appertaining to the internal polity of the
separate States, the Congress, by the nature of our constitution,
have no authority to interfere with it.</p>

<p>As to your demand of compensation to those persons,
we forbear enumerating our reasons for thinking it ill
founded. In the moment of conciliatory overtures, it
would not be proper to call certain scenes into view, over
which a variety of considerations should induce both parties
at present to draw a veil. Permit us therefore only to
repeat, that we cannot stipulate for such compensation,
unless on your part it be agreed, to make retribution to
our citizens for the heavy losses they have sustained by the
unnecessary destruction of private property.</p>

<p>We have already agreed to an amnesty more extensive
than justice required, and full as extensive as humanity
could demand. We can therefore only repeat that it cannot
be extended farther. We should be sorry, if the absolute
impossibility of our complying further with your propositions,
should induce Great Britain to continue the war
for the sake of those who caused and prolonged it. But
if that should be the case, we hope that the utmost latitude
will not be again given to its rigors.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the issue of this negotiation, be assured,
Sir, that we shall always acknowledge the liberal,
manly, and candid manner in which you have conducted it,
and that we shall remain, with the warmest sentiments of
esteem and regard, Sir, your most obedient and very humble
servants,</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have been honored with your favor of the 5th inst.,

<p class="translation"><i>Third Set of Articles.</i></p>

<p><i>Monday, November 25th, 1782.</i> The three Commissioners,
Adams, Franklin, and Jay, met at Mr Oswald's
lodgings at the <i>Hôtel de Muscovie</i>, and after some conferences
Mr Oswald delivered them the following Articles,
as fresh proposals of the British Ministry, sent by Mr
Strachey, viz;</p>

<p>Articles agreed upon by and between Richard Oswald,
the Commissioner of his Britannic Majesty, for treating of
peace with the Commissioners of the United States of
America, in behalf of his said Majesty, on the one part,
and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay, three
of the Commissioners of the said States, for treating of
peace with the Commissioner of his said Majesty, on their
behalf on the other part, to be inserted in, and to constitute
the treaty of peace, proposed to be concluded between the
Crown of Great Britain and the said United States, but
which treaty is not to be concluded, until the terms of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
peace shall be agreed upon between Great Britain and
France, and his Britannic Majesty shall be ready to conclude
such treaty accordingly.</p>

<p>Whereas reciprocal advantages and mutual convenience
are found by experience to form the only permanent
foundation of peace and friendship between States, it is
agreed to form the Articles of the proposed treaty on such
principles of liberal equity and reciprocity, as that partial
advantages, (those seeds of discord,) being excluded, such
a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse between the two
countries may be established, as to promise and secure to
both perpetual peace and harmony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article i.</span> His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the
said United States, viz, New Hampshire, Massachusetts
Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Georgia, to be free, sovereign and independent States, that
he treats with them as such, and for himself, his heirs and
successors, relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety,
and territorial rights of the same, and every part
thereof; and, that all disputes which might arise in future
on the subject of the boundaries of the said United States
may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared, that
the following are and shall be their boundaries, viz;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article ii.</span> From the northwest angle of Nova
Scotia, viz; that angle which is formed by a line drawn
due north from the source of St Croix river to the highlands,
along the said highlands, which divide those rivers
that empty themselves into the river St Lawrence from
those which fall into the Atlantic ocean, to the northwesternmost
head of Connecticut river, thence down along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
middle of that river to the 45th degree of north latitude;
from thence by a line due west on said latitude until it
strikes the river Iroquois or Cataroquy; thence along the
middle of said river into Lake Ontario, through the middle
of said Lake until it strikes the communication by
water between that Lake and Lake Erie; thence along the
middle of said communication, into Lake Erie, through
the middle of said Lake, until it arrives at the water communication
between that Lake and Lake Huron; thence
along the middle of said water communication into Lake
Huron; thence through the middle of the said Lake,
to the water communication between that Lake and Lake
Superior; thence through Lake Superior, northward of the
Isles Royal and Philippeaux to the Long Lake; thence
through the middle of said Long Lake, and the water communication
between it and the Lake of the Woods, to the
said Lake of the Woods; thence through the said Lake to
the most northwestern point thereof; and from thence on a
due western course to the river Mississippi, thence by a
line to be drawn along the middle of the said river Mississippi
until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the
31st degree of north latitude. South by a line to be
drawn due east from the determination of the line last
mentioned, in the latitude of 31 degrees north of the equator
to the middle of the river Apalachicola, or Catahouchi;
thence along the middle thereof to its junction with
the Flint river, thence straight to the head of St Mary's
river; and thence down along the middle of St Mary's
river to the Atlantic ocean. East by a line to be drawn
along the middle of the river St Croix, from its mouth in
the Bay of Fundy to its source; and from its source directly
north, to the aforesaid highlands, which divide the

rivers that fall into the Atlantic ocean from those which
fall into the river St Lawrence; comprehending all Islands
within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the United
States, and lying between lines to be drawn due east from
the point where the aforesaid boundaries between Nova
Scotia on the one part, and East Florida on the other shall
respectively touch the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic
ocean; excepting such Islands as now are, or heretofore
have been, within the limits of the said Province of Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article iii.</span> The citizens of the said United
States shall have <i>the liberty</i> of taking fish of every kind
on all the banks of Newfoundland, and also in the Gulf
of St Lawrence; and also to dry and cure their fish on
the shores of the Isle of Sables and on the shores of
any of the unsettled bays, harbors and creeks of the
Magdalen Islands, in the Gulf of St Lawrence, so long
as such bays, harbors and creeks shall continue and
remain unsettled; on condition that the citizens of the
said United States do not exercise the fishery, but at
the distance of three leagues from all the coast belonging
to Great Britain, as well those of the continent as
those of the islands situated in the Gulf of St Lawrence.
And as to what relates to the fishery on the
coast of the Island of Cape Breton out of the said gulf,
the citizens of the said United States shall not be permitted
to exercise the said fishery, but at the distance
of fifteen leagues from the coasts of the Island of Cape
Breton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article iv.</span> It is agreed, that the British creditors
shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery
of the full value, in sterling money, of such <i>bona fide</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
debts as were contracted by any persons who are citizens
of the United States, before the year 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article v.</span> It is agreed, that restitution shall be
made of all estates, rights and properties in America,
which have been confiscated during the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vi.</span> There shall be a full and entire
amnesty of all acts and offences, which have been or
may be supposed to have been committed on either
side, by reason of the war, and in the course thereof;
and no one shall hereafter suffer in life or person, or
be deprived of his property, for the part he may have
taken therein. All persons in confinement on that
account, shall immediately on the ratification of the
treaty in America, be set at liberty; all prosecutions
which may be depending in consequence of any of the
said offences, shall cease, and no fresh prosecutions
shall at any time hereafter be commenced thereupon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vii.</span> There shall be a firm and perpetual
peace between his Britannic Majesty and the said
States, and between the subjects of the one, and the
citizens of the other; wherefore all hostilities both by
sea and land shall then immediately cease; all prisoners
on both sides shall be set at liberty; and his
Britannic Majesty shall with all convenient speed and
without causing any destruction, withdraw all his armies,
garrisons and fleets from the said United States,
and from every port, place and harbor within the
same, leaving in all fortifications the American artillery
that may be therein. And shall also order and
cause all archives, records and papers, belonging to
any of the said States or their citizens, which in the
course of the war may have fallen into the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
his officers, to be forthwith restored and delivered to
the proper States and persons to whom they belong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article viii.</span> The navigation of the Mississippi,
from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free

<p><span class="smcap">Separate Article.</span> It is hereby understood and
agreed, that in case Great Britain, at the end of the
present war, shall be, or be put in possession of West
Florida, the line of north boundary between the said
province and the United States, shall be a line drawn
from the mouth of the river Yazoo, where it unites
with the river Mississippi, due east to the river Apalachicola.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE PROPOSED AND READ TO THE COMMISSIONERS,
BEFORE SIGNING THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h3>

<p>It is agreed, that his Britannic Majesty will earnestly
recommend it to his Parliament to provide for
and make a compensation to the merchants and shopkeepers
of Boston, whose goods and merchandise were
seized and taken out of their stores, warehouses and
shops, by order of General Gage and others of his
commanders and officers there; and also to the inhabitants
of Philadelphia, for the goods taken away by his
army there; and to make compensation, also, for the
tobacco, rice, indigo, and negroes, &amp;c. seized and carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
off by his armies under Generals Arnold, Cornwallis,
and others, from the States of Virginia, North
and South Carolina, and Georgia, and also for all vessels
and cargoes, belonging to the inhabitants of the said
United States, which were stopped, seized, or taken,
either in the ports, or on the seas, by his Governors,
or by his ships of war, before the declaration of war
against the said States.</p>

<p>And it is farther agreed, that his Britannic Majesty
will also earnestly recommend it to his Parliament to
make compensation for all the towns, villages, and
farms, burnt and destroyed by his troops, or adherents,
in the said United States.</p>

<h3>FACTS.</h3>

<p>There existed a free commerce, upon mutual faith,
between Great Britain and America. The merchants
of the former credited the merchants and planters of
the latter, with great quantities of goods, on the common
expectation, that the merchants, having sold the
goods, would make the accustomed remittances; that
the planters would do the same by the labor of their
negroes, and the produce of that labor, tobacco, rice,
indigo, &amp;c.</p>

<p>England, before the goods were sold in America,
sends an armed force, seizes those goods in the stores;
some even in the ships that brought them, and carries
them off; seizes, also, and carries off the tobacco,
rice, and indigo, provided by the planters to make returns,
and even the negroes, from whose labor they
might hope to raise other produce for that purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Britain now demands that the debts shall, nevertheless,
be paid.</p>

<p>Will she, can she, justly, refuse making compensation
for such seizures?</p>

<p>If a draper, who had sold a piece of linen to a neighbor
on credit, should follow him, take the linen from
him by force, and then send a bailiff to arrest him for
the debt, would any court of law or equity award the
payment of the debt, without ordering a restitution of
the cloth?</p>

<p>Will not the debtors in America cry out, that, if
this compensation be not made, they were betrayed
by the pretended credit, and are now doubly ruined;
first, by the enemy, and then by the negotiators at
Paris, the goods and negroes sold them being taken
from them, with all they had besides, and they are
now to be obliged to pay for what they have been
robbed of?</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have received the letter you did us the honor to
write on the 25th instant.</p>

<p>Our country has had early and repeated proofs both of
your readiness and abilities to do her service. The prospect
of an inactive campaign in America induced us to
adopt the opinion, that you might be more useful here than
there; especially, in case the negotiation for peace, on the
part of France in England, should be committed to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
management; for your knowledge of our affairs and attachment
to our interest, might have been very advantageous
to us on such an occasion. But as an opportunity
now offers of your being instrumental in producing a co-operation,
which would, probably, put a glorious and
speedy termination to the war in America, we, for our
part, perfectly approve of your going with Count d'Estaing,
in the manner proposed.</p>

<h3>PROVISIONAL ARTICLES OF PEACE.</h3>

<p>Articles agreed upon by and between Richard Oswald,
Esq. the Commissioner of his Britannic Majesty for treating
of peace with the Commissioners of the United States
of America, in behalf of his said Majesty on the one part,
and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and
Henry Laurens, four of the Commissioners of the said
States for treating of peace with the Commissioner of his
said Majesty, on their behalf, on the other part; to be

so long as the same shall remain unsettled; but so soon as
the same or either of them shall be settled, it shall not be
lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such
settlement, without a previous agreement for that purpose,
with the inhabitants, proprietors, or possessors of the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article iv.</span> It is agreed, that creditors on either
side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery
of the full value, in sterling money, of all <i>bona fide</i> debts,
heretofore contracted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article v.</span> It is agreed, that the Congress shall
earnestly recommend it to the Legislatures of the respective
States, to provide for the restitution of all estates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
rights, and properties, which have been confiscated, belonging
to real British subjects, and also of the estates, rights,
and properties of persons resident in districts in the possession
of his Majesty's arms, and who have not borne arms
against the said United States; and that persons of any
other description shall have free liberty to go to any part
or parts of any of the Thirteen United States, and therein
to remain twelve months unmolested in their endeavors to
obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights, and
properties, as may have been confiscated. And that Congress
shall also earnestly recommend to the several States,
a reconsideration and revision of all acts or laws regarding
the premises, so as to render the said laws or acts
perfectly consistent, not only with justice and equity, but
with that spirit of conciliation, which on the return of the
blessings of peace should universally prevail. And that
Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several
States, that the estates, rights, and properties, of such last
mentioned persons shall be restored to them, they refunding
to any persons who may be now in possession, the <i>bona
fide</i> price (where any has been given) which such persons
may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights,
and properties, since the confiscation. And it is agreed,
that all persons who have any interest in confiscated lands,
either by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall
meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their
just rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vi.</span> That there shall be no future confiscations

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
either in his person, liberty, or property, and that
those who may be in confinement on such charges at the
time of the ratification of the treaty in America, shall be
immediately set at liberty, and the prosecutions so commenced
be discontinued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vii.</span> There shall be a firm and perpetual
peace, between his Britannic Majesty and the said States,
and between the subjects of the one and the citizens of the
other, wherefore all hostilities, both by sea and land, shall
then immediately cease. All prisoners on both sides shall
be set at liberty; and his Britannic Majesty shall, with all
convenient speed, and without causing any destruction, or
carrying away any negroes or other property of the American
inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garrisons, and
fleets, from the said United States, and from every port,
place, and harbor, within the same, leaving in all fortifications
the American artillery that may be therein. And
shall also order and cause all archives, records, deeds, and
papers belonging to any of the said States, or their citizens,
which in the course of the war may have fallen into the
hands of his officers, to be forthwith restored and delivered
to the proper States and persons to whom they belong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article viii.</span> The navigation of the Mississippi river,

and without requiring any compensation.

<h3>TO FRANCIS DANA AT PETERSBURG.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, December 12th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have the honor to congratulate you on the signature
of the preliminary treaty of peace, between his Britannic
Majesty and the United States of America, to be
inserted in the definitive treaty when France and Britain
shall have agreed upon their terms. The articles, of which
we do ourselves the honor to enclose you a copy, were
completed on the 30th of last month.</p>

<p>To us, at this distance, the present opportunity appears
to be the most favorable for you to communicate your mission
to the Ministers of the Empress of Russia, and to the
Ministers of the other neutral powers residing at her Court,
and if you have no objections, we presume you will wish
to be furnished with the enclosed paper, to communicate
at the same time.</p>

<p>We heartily wish you success, and if you should inform
us of a fair prospect of it, we shall propose an article in
the definitive treaty, to secure the freedom of navigation,
according to the principles of the late marine treaty between
the neutral powers.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, December 14th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have the honor to congratulate Congress on the
signature of the preliminaries of a peace between the
Crown of Great Britain and the United States of
America, to be inserted in a definitive treaty so soon
as the terms between the Crowns of France and Great
Britain shall be agreed on. A copy of the Articles is
here enclosed, and we cannot but flatter ourselves,
that they will appear to Congress, as they do to all of
us, to be consistent with the honor and interest of the
United States, and we are persuaded Congress would
be more fully of that opinion if they were apprized of
all the circumstances and reasons which have influenced
the negotiation. Although it is impossible for
us to go into that detail, we think it necessary nevertheless
to make a few remarks on such of the Articles,
as appear most to require elucidation.</p>

<p class="translation"><i>Remarks on Article 2d, relative to Boundaries.</i></p>

<p>The Court of Great Britain insisted on retaining all
the territories comprehended within the Province of
Quebec, by the Act of Parliament respecting it. They
contended that Nova Scotia should extend to the river
Kennebec; and they claimed not only all the lands in
the western country and on the Mississippi, which
were not expressly included in our charters and governments,
but also all such lands within them as remained
ungranted by the King of Great Britain. It
would be endless to enumerate all the discussions and
arguments on the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>We knew this Court and Spain to be against our
claims to the western country, and having no reason
to think that lines more favorable could ever have
been obtained, we finally agreed to those described in
this Article; indeed they appear to leave us little to
complain of, and not much to desire. Congress will
observe, that although our northern line is in a certain
part below the latitude of fortyfive, yet in others it
extends above it, divides the Lake Superior, and gives
us access to its western and southern waters, from
which a line in that latitude would have excluded us.</p>

<p class="translation"><i>Remarks on Article 4th, respecting Creditors.</i></p>

<p>We had been informed that some of the States had
confiscated British debts, but although each State has
a right to bind its own citizens, yet in our opinion,
it appertains solely to Congress, in whom exclusively
are vested the rights of making war and peace,
to pass acts against the subjects of a power with which
the Confederacy may be at war. It therefore only
remained for us to consider, whether this Article is
founded in justice and good policy.</p>

<p>In our opinion no acts of government could dissolve
the obligations of good faith, resulting from lawful
contracts between individuals of the two countries
prior to the war. We knew that some of the British
creditors were making common cause with the refugees,
and other adversaries of our independence;
besides, sacrificing private justice to reasons of State
and political convenience, is always an odious measure;
and the purity of our reputation in this respect,
in all foreign commercial countries, is of infinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
more importance to us than all the sums in question.
It may also be remarked, that American and British
creditors are placed on an equal footing.</p>

<p class="translation"><i>Remarks on Articles 5th and 6th, respecting Refugees.</i></p>

<p>These Articles were among the first discussed, and
the last agreed to. And had not the conclusion of this
business, at the time of its date, been particularly important
to the British administration, the respect,
which both in London and Versailles, is supposed to
be due to the honor, dignity and interest of royalty,
would probably have forever prevented our bringing
this Article so near to the views of Congress and the
sovereign rights of the States as it now stands.
When it is considered, that it was utterly impossible
to render this Article perfectly consistent, both with
American and British ideas of honor, we presume that
the middle line adopted by this Article, is as little
unfavorable to the former as any that could in reason
be expected.</p>

<p>As to the Separate Article, we beg leave to observe,
that it was our policy to render the navigation of the
river Mississippi so important to Britain, as that their
views might correspond with ours on that subject.
Their possessing the country on the river, north of the
line from the Lake of the Woods, affords a foundation
for their claiming such navigation. And as the importance
of West Florida to Britain was for the same
reason rather to be strengthened than otherwise, we
thought it advisable to allow them the extent contained
in the Separate Article, especially as before the
war it had been annexed by Britain to West Florida,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and would operate as an additional inducement to their
joining with us in agreeing, that the navigation of the
river should forever remain open to both. The map
used in the course of our negotiations was Mitchell's.</p>

<p>As we had reason to imagine that the Articles
respecting the boundaries, the refugees, and fisheries,
did not correspond with the policy of this Court, we
did not communicate the preliminaries to the Minister
until after they were signed; and not even then the
<i>Separate Article</i>. We hope that these considerations
will excuse our having so far deviated from the spirit
of our instructions. The Count de Vergennes, on perusing
the Articles, appeared surprised, but not displeased,
at their being so favorable to us.</p>

<p>We beg leave to add our advice, that copies be sent
us of the accounts directed to be taken by the different
States, of the unnecessary devastations and sufferings
sustained by them from the enemy in the course of the
war. Should they arrive before the signature of the
definitive treaty they might possibly answer very good
purposes.</p>

<p>
With great respect we have the honor to be, Sir,
your most obedient and most humble servants,</p>

STIPULATIONS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, December 31st, 1782.</p>

<p>On the report of the committee to whom was referred
a letter of the 14th of October last, from the Minister
Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Ministers Plenipotentiary for
negotiating peace, be instructed, in any commercial
stipulations with Great Britain, which may be comprehended
in a treaty of peace, to endeavor to obtain for
the citizens and inhabitants of the United States, a
direct commerce to all parts of the British dominions
and possessions, in like manner as all parts of the
United States may be opened to a direct commerce of
British subjects; or, at least, that such direct commerce
be extended to all parts of the British dominions
and possessions in Europe and the West Indies.
And the said Ministers are informed that stipulations
are particularly expected by Congress, in case the citizens
and subjects of each party are to be admitted to
an equality in matters of commerce with the natives
of the other party.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, March 25th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I am now to acknowledge the favor of your joint letter
by the Washington, together with a copy of the Preliminary
Articles; both were laid before Congress. The Articles
have met with their warmest approbation, and have
been generally seen by the people in the most favorable
point of view.</p>

<p>The steadiness manifested in not treating without an
express acknowledgment of your independence previous
to a treaty is approved, and it is not doubted but it accelerated
that declaration. The boundaries are as extensive
as we have a right to expect; and we have nothing to
complain of with respect to the fisheries. My sentiments
as to English debts you have in a former letter. No
honest man could wish to withhold them. A little forbearance
in British creditors, till people have recovered in
part from the losses sustained by the war, will be necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
to render this Article palatable, and indeed to secure
more effectually the debt. The Article relative to the
loyalists is not quite so accurately expressed as I could
wish it to have been. What for instance is intended by
<i>real British subjects</i>? It is clear to me that it will operate
nothing in their favor in any State in the union, but as you
made no secret of this to the British Commissioners, they
will have nothing to charge you with; and indeed the whole
clause seems rather to have been inserted to appease the
clamor of these poor wretches, than to satisfy their wants.
Britain would have discovered more candor and magnanimity
in paying to them three months' expense of the war
establishment, which would have been an ample compensation
for all their losses, and left no germ of dissatisfaction
to bud and bloom and ripen into discontents here. Another
mad Administration may think the noncompliance of
the Legislatures with the recommendations of Congress on
this subject, a sufficient cause for giving themselves and us
new troubles. You however were perfectly right in agreeing
to the Article, the folly was theirs, who did not either
insist upon more, or give up this.</p>

<p>But, Gentlemen, though the issue of your treaty has
been successful, though I am satisfied that we are much
indebted to your firmness and perseverance, to your accurate
knowledge of our situation, and of our wants for this
success, yet I feel no little pain at the distrust manifested
in the management of it; particularly in signing the treaty
without communicating it to the Court of Versailles till
after the signature, and in concealing the Separate Article
from it even when signed. I have examined with the
most minute attention all the reasons assigned in your several
letters to justify these suspicions. I confess they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
not appear to strike me so forcibly as they have done
you; and it gives me pain, that the character for candor
and fidelity to its engagements, which should always characterise
a great people, should have been impeached
thereby. The concealment was in my opinion absolutely
unnecessary; for had the Court of France disapproved
the terms you had made, after they had been agreed upon,
they could not have acted so absurdly as to counteract
you at that late day; and thereby put themselves in the
power of an enemy, who would certainly betray them, and
perhaps justify you in making terms for yourselves.</p>

<p>The Secret Article is no otherwise important, than as
it carries in it the seeds of enmity to the Court of Spain,
and shows a marked preference for an open enemy. It
would in my opinion, have been much better to have fixed
on the same boundaries for West Florida, into whatever
hands it fell, without showing any preference, or rendering
concealment necessary; since all the arguments in favor
of the cession to England would then have operated with
equal force, and nothing have been lost by it; for there
can be no doubt, that whether Florida shall at the close of
the war be ceded to England or to Spain, it will be ceded
as it was held by Britain. The Separate Article is not, I
suppose, by this time a secret in Europe; it can hardly be
considered as such in America. The treaty was sent out
to the General with this Article annexed by Sir Guy
Carleton, without the smallest injunction of secrecy. So
that I dare say it has been pretty generally read at head
quarters. Congress still conceal it here. I feel for the
embarrassment explanations on this subject must subject
you to, when this secret is known to your allies.</p>

<p>I intended to have submitted this letter to Congress, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
I find there is not the least prospect of obtaining any decision
upon it in time to send by this conveyance, if at all.
I leave you to collect their sentiments, as far as I know
them, from the following state of their proceedings. After
your joint and separate letters, and the journals had been
submitted to them by me, and had been read, they were
referred back to me to report upon, when I wrote them
a letter, and when it was taken into consideration, motions
were made and debated a whole day. After which
the letter and motions were committed, and a report
brought in. This was under consideration two days, when
the arrival of a vessel from Cadiz with letters from the
Count d'Estaing and the Marquis de Lafayette, containing
accounts, that the preliminaries were signed, induced many
members to think it would be improper to proceed in the
report, and in that state it remains without any express
decision. From this you will draw your own inferences.</p>

<p>I make no apology for the part I have taken in this
business. I am satisfied you will readily acquit me for
having discharged what I conceived to be my duty upon
such a view of things as you presented to me. In declaring
my sentiments freely, I invite you to treat me with
equal candor in your letters, and in sending original papers,
I guard against misrepresentations that might give you pain.
Upon the whole I have the pleasure of assuring you, that
the services you have rendered your country, in bringing
this business to a happy issue, are very gratefully received
by them; however we may differ in sentiments about the
mode of doing it.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the extreme negligence of the different
States, has prevented, and will probably long prevent, my
being able to send you a state of the injury done to real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
property, and the number of slaves destroyed and carried off
by the British troops and their allies, though no pains have
been, or shall be wanting, on my part to urge them to it.</p>

<p>Whereas Provisional Articles were signed at Paris
on the 30th day of November last, between the Ministers
Plenipotentiary of the United States of America
for treating of peace, and the Minister Plenipotentiary
of his Britannic Majesty, to be inserted in, and to constitute
the treaty of peace proposed to be concluded
between the United States of America and his Britannic
Majesty, when terms of peace should be agreed
upon between their Most Christian and Britannic Majesties;
and whereas preliminaries for restoring peace
between their Most Christian and Britannic Majesties
were signed at Versailles, on the 20th day of January
last, by the Ministers of their Most Christian and
Britannic Majesties; and whereas preliminaries for
restoring peace between the said King of Great Britain

<p>By which said Preliminary Articles it has been
agreed, that as soon as the same were ratified, hostilities
between the said Kings, their kingdoms, states
and subjects, should cease in all parts of the world;
and it was further agreed, that all vessels and effects
that might be taken in the Channel and in the North
Seas, after the space of twelve days from the ratification
of the said Preliminary Articles, should be restored;
that the term should be one month from the
Channel and North Seas as far as the Canary Islands,
inclusively, whether in the ocean or the Mediterranean;
two months from the said Canary Islands as far

their subjects and possessions respectively; upon condition,
that on the part and in the name of the United

Britannic Majesty, his subjects and his possessions, at
the terms and epochs agreed upon between his said
Majesty the King of Great Britain, his Majesty the

those three Crowns, and to produce the same
effects;</p>

Articles, between their Most Christian and Britannic
Majesties, were exchanged by their Ministers
on the 3d day of February last; and between his
Britannic Majesty and the King of Spain, on the 9th
day of February last;</p>

cessation of hostilities between the United States of
America and his Britannic Majesty, should be conformable

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, April 21st, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of the Provisional Articles, and a
subsequent account brought by a vessel, despatched by
Count d'Estaing, I wrote letters to Sir Guy Carleton
and Admiral Digby, to which I received answers.
You will find them cold and distant. Those they
wrote to the Minister of France, in answer to similar
communications made by him, were still more so, and
contain the same illiberal doubts which are mentioned
in mine, expressed in much stronger terms. When
they received an authentic account of the treaty, they
sent a copy of it, (<i>no part</i> being omitted) to Congress,
through the General. When the Proclamation for the
cessation of hostilities was received at New York, it
was sent to me by an officer with a letter, to which I
returned an answer.</p>

<p>After this two great questions were agitated in Congress.
1st. Whether they should proceed to the immediate
ratification of the Provisional Articles; and
2dly. Whether they should release their prisoners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Some maintained with respect to the first of these
points, that they knew not in what light to consider
the Provisional Articles, whether as preliminaries or a
definitive treaty. That the preamble said they were
to constitute the treaty, while at the same time, they
were only to be inserted in it. These terms they considered
as contradictory; and they wished to have explanations
from you on this head, to know what the
operation of a ratification would be, and they inferred
from your silence, that none was necessary. They
observed, that no time was set for the evacuation of
New York; that the ratification would in some measure
compel them to release their prisoners, and thus
strengthen their hands, when it was possible a definitive
treaty might not take effect between Great Britain
and France; and that the ratification and the
restoration of prisoners, if it left us nothing more to
do, was in some sort to desert our allies. To this it
was answered, that the Provisional Articles were only
to be received as preliminary, that from the very nature
of them, they could not he definitive; that the
ratification would not alter the nature of them, but
confirm them as they stood; that they were confessedly
very advantageous to us; that the neglecting any such
acceptation of them as was necessary on our part
would give the enemy a pretence for violating the
stipulations they contained; that the principal points
between France and Great Britain being settled, we
had no reason to apprehend a failure of a definitive
treaty; that it was important to show, that we were
determined to adhere in every particular to the engagements
you had made. These arguments prevailed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and a resolution passed directing the ratification which
I enclose. It is probable that the definitive treaty will
be signed before this can reach you, otherwise it
would be extremely desirable that some ambiguities in
the Provisional Articles should be cleared up, and
other objects, which have been at different times
touched upon in my public letters, attended to.</p>

<p>The sixth Article is not so precisely expressed as to
point out to what time the word <i>future</i> refers, whether to
the signature of the Provisional Articles, whether to the act,
which gave it the force of a treaty, or to the definitive
treaty. Though I should suppose the second to be the intention
from the opposition between the words <i>now</i>, and
the time of the ratification in America.</p>

<p>The seventh Article leaves the time for the evacuation of
New York upon so loose a footing, that I fear our troublesome
guests will long continue to be such, unless a day is
fixed on for their departure, in the definitive treaty. You
can easily conceive the impatience that the distressed inhabitants
of New Fork feel at every moment's delay; and
the fears and jealousies that prevail among them lest it
should be meant to retain these posts as pledges for the
performance of the stipulations in favor of the tories. By
the debates in Parliament on the 3d of March, it is evident
that they had then no orders to evacuate.</p>

<p>You will observe that the ratification does not extend to
the Separate Article. The treaty between Spain and Great
Britain renders it unnecessary; and Congress not caring
to express any sentiment upon that subject, I refer you to
my letters to Dr Franklin and Mr Jay upon the subject of
a free trade with the West Indies, and the logwood trade,
which are important objects here; and, I hope, will be attended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
to in your definitive treaty. It were to be wished
that the ambiguity with respect to the time of the cessation
of hostilities upon this coast was cleared up, and the
construction we put upon it adopted, to wit, that by <i>as far
as the Canaries</i>, was intended the latitude of the Canaries,
which construction can be supported by a variety of
arguments, and is extremely important to us, as a number
of our vessels have been taken since the 3d of March.</p>

<h3>MR GRAND TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, May 10th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>It is some months ago since I had the honor to write
you, and am well persuaded, although I received no answer
thereto, that it will have engaged your attention. I earnestly
wish it may have been productive of an improvement
to the finances of Congress, which I then foresaw would
be short of our wants, and which is, unfortunately, too
much the case at present.</p>

<p>Last month, I remitted to the honorable Robert Morris,
the state of his account; the balance of which was
413,892 livres <i>13c.</i> <i>9s.</i> due to me. This, added to the
subsequent payments I had to make, would have thrown
me into a state of perplexity, had it not been for the assistance
given me by the <i>Garde du Trésor Royal</i>.</p>

<p>You will see, Gentlemen, by the statement I have the
honor to enclose for your consideration, that the sums I
am to pay, exceed by one million those that are to be paid
me. And making even abstraction of all that is not Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Morris' bill, there still remains a defect of 500,000 livres,
independent of the allowance to be made for his usual
wants, from January 24th (date of his last bills) up to the
12th of March.</p>

<p>I am happy to have it in my power to say, that I have
exerted to this instant, all that my zeal and my faculties
could suggest to me. Did the last keep pace with the
former, I should never have applied but to them. However,
the state of affairs is such now, that a resolution must
be taken relative thereto; and, even, without delay; the
bearers of Mr Morris's bills growing so urgent upon me, that
rather than to have occasioned any difficulty before I
could be informed of your resolution, I preferred accepting
a further sum of 54,000 livres this day.</p>

<p>
I crave your Excellencies will honor me with a quick
answer; meantime, I remain &amp;c.</p>

<h3>M. DE LAFAYETTE TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, May 12th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Having yesterday conferred with Count de Vergennes
upon some public concerns, he requested I would tell you
what, instead of troubling you with the demand of a meeting,
I think better to mention in this note.</p>

<p>The several powers, said he, are going to make up their
treaties, and when ready to sign, they will, of course,
meet to do it all together. The mediation of the Emperor
and that of Russia have been required, and under that mediation
the French treaty will be signed; it now rests with
America to know, if she will conclude her treaty under the
mediation, or chooses to let it alone. There is no necessity
for it. But, in case you prefer to have it, Count de
Vergennes thinks it is time to join with England in making
a combined application to the Court of Vienna and that of
Petersburg.</p>

<p>So far, Gentlemen, I have been requested to speak to
you. I will add, that from my last conferences on the
subject, I hope we may get the harbor of L'Orient, as we
have wished, for the American trade.</p>

<p>Be pleased to accept the assurances of my great and
affectionate respect.</p>

<p>Whereas, for the perfecting and establishing the peace,
friendship, and good understanding so happily commenced
by the Provisional Articles signed at Paris, the thirtieth day
of November last, by the Commissioners of us, and our
good friends, the United States of America, viz; New
Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the three
lower Counties on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, in North America,
and for opening, promoting, and rendering perpetual, the
mutual intercourse of trade and commerce, between our
kingdoms and the dominions of the said United States,
we have thought proper to invest some fit person with
full powers on our part to meet and confer with the Ministers
of the said United States, now residing at Paris, duly
authorised for the accomplishing of such laudable and salutary
purposes.</p>

<p>Now know ye, that we, reposing special trust and confidence
in the wisdom, loyalty, diligence, and circumspection
of our trusty and well beloved David Hartley, (on whom
we have heretofore conferred the rank of our Minister Plenipotentiary,)
have nominated, constituted and appointed,
and by these presents do nominate, constitute and appoint
him, our true, certain, and undoubted Commissioner, Procurator,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
and Plenipotentiary; giving and granting to him all,
and all manner of faculty, power, and authority, together
with general, as well as special order (so as the general
do not derogate from the special, nor on the contrary,) for
us, and in our name, to meet, confer, treat, and conclude
with the Minister or Ministers, furnished with sufficient
powers, on the part of our said good friends, the United
States of America, of and concerning all such matters and
things as may be requisite and necessary for accomplishing
and completing the several ends and purposes herein before
mentioned, and also for us, and in our name to sign
such treaty or treaties, convention or conventions, or other
instruments whatsoever, as may be agreed upon in the
premises; and mutually to deliver and receive the same in
exchange, and to do and perform all such other acts, matters,
and things, as may be anyways proper and conducive
to the purposes abovementioned, in as full and ample form
and manner, and with the like validity and effect, as we
ourself, if we were present, could do and perform the
same; engaging and promising, on our royal word, that
we will accept, ratify, and confirm in the most effectual
manner all such acts, matters, and things, as shall be so
transacted and concluded by our aforesaid Commissioner,
Procurator, and Plenipotentiary, and that we will never
suffer any person to violate the same, in the whole, or in
part, or to act contrary thereto.</p>

<p>In testimony and confirmation of all which, we have
caused our great seal of Great Britain to be affixed to
these presents, signed with our royal hand.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
At the Court of St James, May 14th, 1783.</p>

<p>Present. The King's Most Excellent Majesty in
Council.</p>

<p>Whereas, by an act of Parliament passed this session,
entitled, "An Act for preventing certain instruments from
being required from ships belonging to the United States
of America, and to give to his Majesty, for a limited time,
certain powers for the better carrying on trade and commerce
between the subjects of his Majesty's dominions and
the inhabitants of the said United States," it is, among
other things, enacted, that, during the continuance of the
said act, it shall, and may be lawful for his Majesty in
Council, by order or orders to be issued and published
from time to time, to give such directions, and to make
such regulations with respect to duties, drawbacks, or
otherwise, for carrying on the trade and commerce between
the people and territories belonging to the Crown of
Great Britain, and the people and territories of the said
United States, as to his Majesty in Council shall appear
most expedient and salutary, any law, usage, or custom to

or merchandises, being the growth or production of any of
the territories of the said United States of America, may,
(until further order) be imported directly from thence into
any of the ports of this kingdom, either in British or American
ships, by British subjects, or by any of the people inhabiting
in, and belonging to the said United States, or any
of them, and such goods and merchandises shall and may
be entered and landed in any port in this kingdom, upon
payment of the same duties, as the like sort of goods are,

subjects in British ships from any British island or plantation
in America, and no other, notwithstanding such goods
or merchandises, or the ships in which the same may be
brought, may not be accompanied with the certificates, or
other documents heretofore required by law; and it is
hereby further ordered and directed, that there shall be
the same drawbacks, exemptions, and bounties on merchandises

territories of the said United States of America, or any of
them, as are allowed upon the exportation of the like
goods or merchandise, to any of the islands, plantations, or

and it is hereby further ordered and directed, that all
American ships and vessels, which shall have voluntarily
come into any port of Great Britain, since the 20th of
January, 1783, shall be admitted, together with the goods

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES' PROPOSED NEW ARTICLES.</h3>

<p class="translation">[Delivered to Dr Franklin on the 20th of May, 1783.]</p>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p>The intention of his Most Christian Majesty and the
United States of North America, in concluding between
them a treaty of amity and commerce, having been, that
their respective subjects should enjoy all the advantages,
privileges, and exemptions, which the most favored nations
enjoy or may enjoy, and his said Majesty and the
United States, wishing to prevent any misunderstandings
that may arise by a false application of the 2d and 3d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Articles of the treaty of commerce of February 6th, 1778,
have thought it proper to determine in a precise manner
the principles which ought to be followed on one part and
the other, concerning the matter in question. In consequence,
it is proposed, that his Majesty and the Congress
of the United States agree to the following Articles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article i.</span> To interpret, as far as is necessary, the 2d
Article of the treaty of amity and commerce, concluded
February 6th, 1778, the United States declare, that all
the advantages, privileges, and exemptions, which are
accorded, or may be accorded hereafter, in regard to navigation
and commerce, to any nation, power, or state,
whatever, shall be common to the French nation, and that
these shall be enjoyed conformably to Article 3d of the
treaty, in such manner that in no case, or under any pretext,
shall the said United States exact any compensation
from his Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article ii.</span> His Most Christian Majesty promises
and engages on his part, to cause the subjects of the United
States to enjoy, in conformity with the 3d Article abovementioned,
all the advantages, privileges, and exemptions,
which the most favored nations now enjoy, or may enjoy
hereafter, and that without exacting any compensation from
the said States.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, May 28th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>By the direction of Congress contained in the enclosed
resolutions, I have the honor to transmit you the correspondence
between General Washington and Sir Guy Carleton,
together with minutes of their conference, when in pursuance
of the invitation of the first, they met in Orange county.
Nothing can be a more direct violation of the seventh Article
of the provisional treaty, than sending off the slaves, under
pretence, that their Proclamations had set them free, as if
a British General had, either by their laws or those of
nations, a right by Proclamation, to deprive any man whatever
of his property. They may with much more propriety
pretend to re-establish every one of their adherents
in all the rights they had before the war, since they engaged
so to do, and the people with whom they made
these engagements were capable of entering into them,
which slaves were not. Or even if they were, the promise
made to them must be under the same limitations with
those made to their other adherents in this country, and
amounts to nothing more than this; "make yourselves free,
and we will protect you in that freedom as long as we can."
The Articles imply, that they were no longer able to protect
them. You will be pleased to remonstrate on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
subject, and inform Congress of the effects of your representations.</p>

<p>We have been much embarrassed by your silence, not
having had a line from you since the Provisional Articles
took effect, nor being at all acquainted with the progress
of the definitive treaty; though the earliest information on
this subject becomes very important. Congress, after
some hesitation have ventured to hope, that it will meet
with no obstructions, and have accordingly discharged by
the enclosed resolution a considerable part of their army
upon those principles of economy which extreme necessity
dictated. As scarce a week passes without several arrivals
from France, Congress complain with some reason of your
silence. For my own part I could wish, that you would
severally impose upon yourselves the task of writing
weekly, and sending your letters to Mr Barclay. As you
are possessed of cyphers, there can be no hazard in this,
where the subject of your correspondence requires secrecy.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, May 31st, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Congress yesterday passed the enclosed resolutions
on the subject of the payment of British debts. The
language they speak requires no comment.</p>

<p>I complained in my last of your long silence, or
rather laid before you the complaints of Congress.
These, I think receive additional force from the intelligence
that I have since had, that the negotiations are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
still going on; and that important propositions have
been made you from Holland. As Congress have adjourned
for two days, and the packet sails tomorrow, I
cannot procure their instructions on this subject;
though I think I may venture to say that they will not
without reluctance go one step further than their
honor requires of them in making new engagements
which may involve them in the disputes of Europe,
from which they wish to be totally disengaged. I
make no observations on these propositions, or your
power to accede to them, being well persuaded that
you will take no step in this business without a full
persuasion that important advantages will result therefrom
to these States. The second proposition, in case
France and Spain should decline acceding to the first,
is more peculiarly delicate from the inability of the
contracting powers to enforce them; if, which is
hardly to be supposed, they should unite in wishing
it.</p>

<p>I cannot help lamenting since so much time has
elapsed before any conclusion is formed, that you had
not thought it advisable to write me on this subject,
explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
measure, and enabling me to take the sense of Congress
thereon; for though they have the highest confidence
in your judgment and knowledge of the true
interests of this country, yet I am persuaded that they
think it a duty to see with their own eyes; and to
form their own conclusions on great national objects,
where there is a possibility of so doing. The experience
of the last war has shown that the propositions of
the Empress of Russia were little more than a dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
letter. Those whom England dared to offend derived
no advantage from them. Our engagement therefore
on this head will, in my opinion, add little weight to
them, unless the great maritime powers of Europe
agree to support them, and they may involve us in
disagreeable discussions. These however are only my
sentiments; those of Congress I am ignorant of.</p>

<p>The fifth and sixth Articles of the provisional treaty
excite much ferment here. For though the most dissatisfied
spirits acknowledge the whole treaty taken
together to answer their highest expectations, yet they
wish to take only what they like, and leave out what
they disapprove; and such is the relaxation of government,
and so great the disorder and uneasiness introduced
by the war, that it will be found very difficult
to bridle the just resentments of some, and the
unfounded apprehensions that others entertain of reimbursement
that may effect their particular interests.</p>

Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty for and in

Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and Henry
Laurens, Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United

of his said Majesty, on their behalf, on the
other part;</p>

<p>Whereas it is expedient, that intercourse and commerce
should be opened, between the people and territories
subject to the Crown of Great Britain and those
of the United States of America, and that this intercourse
and commerce should be established on the
most enlarged principles of reciprocal benefit to both
countries;</p>

<p>1st. It is agreed, that Ministers shall be forthwith
nominated and vested with full powers, to treat, agree,
and conclude, upon a permanent treaty of commerce
between the two powers and their respective citizens,

subjects, in British ships, from any British island, or
plantation in America; and that the subjects of his
Britannic Majesty shall import to, and export from,

<h3>JOHN JAY'S PROPOSED AGREEMENT.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
June, 1783.</p>

<p>Whereas a variety of circumstances and considerations
oppose the forming at present a permanent treaty of commerce,
between the Imperial Crown of Great Britain and
the United States of America; and whereas it is expedient
that a commercial intercourse should be without delay
opened and regulated between the kingdom and territories
of Great Britain and the said States, by a temporary convention,
therefore,

<p>Provided that the subjects of his Britannic Majesty shall
not have any right or claim under the convention, to carry
or import, into the said States any slaves from any part of
the world; it being the intention of the said States entirely
to prohibit the importation thereof.</p>

<p>And whereas questions may arise respecting the operation
of this convention on Ireland, it is agreed that it shall
not restrain that kingdom from accepting from, and granting
to, the said States further and more extensive commercial
privileges than that Island and the British American
Colonies enjoyed with respect to each other before
the late war.</p>

<p>And whereas this convention is dictated by temporary
convenience, and the discussion of questions respecting
reciprocity has, in forming it, been avoided; therefore, it
is agreed, that no arguments shall be drawn from it, for or
against any propositions or claims, which either party may
make in treating of, and framing the proposed future
treaty of commerce.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>By the United States in Congress assembled, June 12th,
1783.</p>

<p>The Committee, to whom was referred a report of the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, on a letter of the 20th of
March last from M. Dumas, and sundry papers enclosed,
report;</p>

<p>That it appears from the said letter and the papers enclosed,
that propositions have been made, on the part of
the States-General, to the Ministers of the United States of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
America at Paris, in order to render an express stipulation
in favor of the freedom of navigation less necessary in the
treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United
Provinces of the Netherlands, either to accede to the
treaty of the armed neutrality already concluded between
some powers of Europe, or to enter into similar engagements
with France, Spain, and the United Provinces of
the Netherlands, or, in case France and Spain should refuse
to enter into a Convention founded on the principles
of the armed neutrality, or wish to delay it till after the
general peace, to form a separate convention for similar
purposes, between the United Provinces of the Netherlands
and the United States of America. That the answers
to these propositions do not appear from the papers
transmitted, though there is room to infer from M. Dumas's
letter of the fourth and eighteenth of February, that
the two first of these propositions were encouraged by our
Ministers, and that the States-General proposed to act in
consequence thereof, and had made the last proposition,
in order to be prepared in case either, or both, of the two
first should fail.</p>

<p>It appears from the report of the Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, that no powers are at present vested in any person
in Europe, to agree to any treaty, similar to that entered
into by Russia, Sweden, Denmark, and the United Provinces
of the Netherlands, after the peace shall be concluded.
The resolution of the 5th of October, 1780, empowers
the Ministers of these States, if invited thereto, to
accede to such regulations conformable to the spirit of the
declaration of Russia, as may be agreed upon by the Congress
expected to assemble, in pursuance of the invitation
of her Imperial Majesty. Our Ministers received no invitation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
and special powers were afterwards given to Mr
Dana, which, in their nature, superseded that resolution.
Mr Dana was by his commission and instructions empowered
to sign the treaty or convention, for the protection
of commerce in behalf of the United States, either with
her Imperial Majesty, in conjunction with the other neutral
powers, or if that shall be inadmissible, separately with
her Imperial Majesty, or any of those, that is, those neutral
powers. The treaty being only made to continue during
the war, his powers terminated with the war, or, at most,
extended only to sign it with the neutral powers, and not
to form a new separate treaty.</p>

<p>Whereupon Congress came to the following resolution.</p>

<p>Whereas the primary object of the resolution of October
5th, 1780, and of the commission and instructions to Mr
Dana, relative to the accession of the United States to the
neutral confederacy, no longer can operate, and as the true
interest of the States requires, that they should be as little
as possible entangled in the politics and controversies of
European nations, it is inexpedient to renew the said
powers either to Mr Dana, or to the other Ministers of
these United States in Europe. But, inasmuch as the
liberal principles, on which the said confederacy was established,
are conceived to be, in general, favorable to
the interests of nations, and, particularly, to those of the
United States, and ought, in that view, to be promoted by
the latter, as far as will consist with their fundamental
policy;</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Ministers Plenipotentiary of these
United States for negotiating a peace be, and they are
hereby instructed, in case they should comprise in the definitive
treaty any stipulation, amounting to a recognition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the rights of neutral nations, to avoid accompanying them
by any engagements which shall oblige the contracting
parties to support those stipulations by arms.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, June 14th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Permit me to address the enclosed Memorial to your
Excellencies, and to explain to you my reasons for so
doing.</p>

<p>It is because many consequences, now at a great distance,
and unforeseen by us, may arise between our two
countries, perhaps from very minute and incidental transactions,
which in their beginnings may be imperceptible
and unsuspected as to their future effects. Our respective
territories are in vicinity, and therefore we must be inseparable.
Great Britain, with the British power in America,
is the only nation with whom, by absolute necessity, you
must have the most intimate concerns, either of friendship
or hostility. All other nations are three thousand miles distant
from you. You <i>may</i> have political connexions with any
of these distant nations, but with regard to Great Britain it
<i>must</i> be so. Political intercourse and interests will obtrude
themselves between our two countries, because they are
the two great powers dividing the continent of North
America. These matters are not to come into discussion
between us now. They are of too much importance,
either to be involved, or even glanced at, in any present
transaction.</p>

<p>Let every eventual principle be kept untouched, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the two nations shall have recovered from the animosities
of the war. Let them have a pacific interval, to consider
deliberately of their mutual and combined interests,
and of their engagements with other nations. Let us not,
at the outset of a temporary convention, adopt the severe
principle of reducing every transaction between the two
countries to the footing of exact reciprocity alone. Such
a principle would cast a gloom upon conciliatory prospects.
America is not restrained from any conciliation with Great
Britain by any treaty with any other power. The principles
of conciliation would be most desirable between Great
Britain and America; and forbearance is the road to conciliation.
After a war of animosities, time should be allowed
for recollection. There are all reasonable appearances
of conciliatory dispositions on all sides, which may
be perfected in time. Let us not, therefore, at such a
moment as this, and without the most urgent necessity,
establish a morose principle between us; if it were a decided
point against amity and conciliation, it would be time
enough to talk of partition and strict reciprocity. To presume
in favor of conciliation may help it forward; to presume
against it, may destroy that conciliation, which might
otherwise have taken place.</p>

<p>But, in the present case, there is more than reason to
presume conciliation. I think myself happy, that I have
it in my power to assure you, from authority, that it is the
fundamental principle of the British Councils, to establish
amity and confidence between Great Britain and the
American States, as a succedaneum for the relation, in
which they formerly stood one to the other. The proof
of this consists, not in words, but in substantial facts. His
Britannic Majesty has been graciously pleased to send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
orders to his commanders in North America, for the
speedy and complete evacuation of all the territories of the
United States. His Majesty has given orders in council,
on the 14th of the last month, for the admission of American
ships and cargoes into Great Britain; and on the 6th
instant, he has given farther orders, permitting the importation
from America of several articles, which have been
usually considered as manufactures. He has, likewise,
provided for the convenience of American merchants, who
may wish to land tobacco in Great Britain for re-exportation.
Upon the same principle, Mr Fox, the Secretary of
State, corresponding with America, has moved for, and
received the liberty of the House of Commons, (<i>nem. con.</i>)
to bring in a bill, that any American merchants, importing
rice into Great Britain, may, upon re-exportation, draw
back the whole duty paid on its first importation. All
these circumstances put together, undoubtedly form the
most indisputable evidence of the disposition, which prevails
in the British Councils to give every facility to the
re-establishment of that intercourse, which must be so beneficial
to both nations.</p>

<p>I am ordered to inform you, that his Majesty entirely
approves of the plan of making a temporary convention, for
the purpose of restoring immediate intercourse and commerce,
and more particularly for the purpose of putting
off, for a time, the decision of that important question, how
far the British acts of navigation ought to be sacrificed to
commercial considerations, drawn from the peculiar circumstances
of the present crisis; a question, which will
require much deliberation, and very much inquiry, before
it can be determined. I am sure, Gentlemen, you will see
and admit the reasonableness of our proceeding, in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
a case, with deliberation and discretion; more especially,
when these acts of prudence do not proceed from any
motives of coolness or reserve towards you. In the meantime,
the temporary convention may proceed upon principles
of real and accommodating reciprocity. For instance,
we agree to put you upon a more favorable footing than
any other nation. We do not ask a rigid reciprocity for
this, because we know, by your present subsisting treaties,
it is not in your power to give it to us. We desire only to
be put upon the footing of other nations with you, and,
yet, we consent that you shall be upon a better footing
with us than any other nation.</p>

<p>Thus far, we must be allowed to be giving something
more than reciprocity, and this we do, as I said before,
because we are unwilling to ask what you are unable to
give. Surely, it is not unreasonable, nor more than, from
principles of reciprocity, we have a right to expect that
you should imitate our conduct in this particular, and that
you should abstain from asking things, under the title of
exact and literal reciprocity, which, upon the consideration
of our case, you must know that we cannot give. Virtual
and substantial reciprocity we are willing to give; literal
reciprocity is impossible, as much from your engagements,
as from our system of navigation.</p>

<p>If we can agree upon an article of intercourse and commerce,
in the nature of a temporary convention, on the
basis of the Memorial, which I had the honor of giving
lately to you, bearing date 19th of May, 1783, no time
need be lost in finishing this business; but with this explanation,
that although it is proposed, that the commerce between
the United States and the British West Indies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
should be free with regard to their respective productions,
yet, that we are not bound to admit the importation of
West India commodities into Great Britain in American
vessels. Believe me, Gentlemen, that this restriction does
not proceed from any invidious disposition towards the
American States. It is imposed by indispensable prudence
and necessity upon the British Ministers, who, in
the present state of things, could not be justified to their
own country, to go hastily to a larger extent of concession.
This point is not to be looked upon merely as commercial,
but as affecting fundamentally the great political system of
British navigation; and you are to consider, that the principle,
upon which the whole of our proposed temporary
convention is to stand, is, that the <i>commerce</i> between the
two countries is to be revived nearly upon the old footing;
but that each nation is to keep in its own hands, the power
of making such regulations respecting <i>navigation</i>, as shall
seem fit. I assure you, that this point has been discussed
by the Ministers of the British cabinet with infinite candor,
and with every possible disposition of amity and favor
towards your country; but the more they have inquired
upon this subject, the more they are overborne by conviction,
that the prejudices upon this matter (if that be the
name these opinions deserve) are so strong, that such a
measure as a relaxation of the act of navigation, in this instance,
never can be taken, but upon such a full and solemn
Parliamentary inquiry, as it is impossible to go into at
this time of the year, and in this stage of the session. I
cannot, therefore, Gentlemen, help flattering myself, that
you, who are so well acquainted with difficulties, which
must embarrass an English administration in a business of
this sort, will rather endeavor to remove them, than to increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
them; and I am sure, that such a plan, on your
part, would ultimately be most conducive to your own objects.
When an amicable intercourse is once opened, and
when conciliatory confidence comes to take place of those
jealousies, which have lately subsisted, you may easily
conceive in how different a manner the whole of this matter
will be considered. I am confident that this will be
the case, but if it is not, the provisions being only temporary,
it will be in the power of the United States, to take
up any hostile mode of proceeding, by restraints and prohibitions,
&amp;c. whenever they may think fit.</p>

<p>I have made use above of the word <i>prejudices</i> in speaking
of the principles of the British act of navigation. I
hope you will accept that term from me, as proceeding so
far in compliance towards the future consideration of the
points now between us, as to keep the question open and
free for discussion. If Great Britain should, in any case,
throw down the barriers of her act of navigation towards
America, she should be very secure against the possible
case of future enmity, or alliance against her. Such considerations
as these, lead to objects far beyond our present
scope or powers. But I must still add one word more
upon this article of <i>prejudices</i>. Such prejudices (if they
are so) are not confined to Great Britain. By your commercial
treaty with France, Article 4th, you are only entitled
to an European trade with that kingdom, and not,
even by that treaty, to any direct commerce between their
West India Islands and the ports of the American States;
much less to the immediate communication between the
French Islands and the dominions of the Crown of France
in Europe. Every public proceeding in England, since
the commencement of our present negotiation for opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the intercourse and commerce between our two countries,
will, I am sure, support me in saying, that we have very
liberally taken the lead; that we have not waited for any
assurance of reciprocity, but have given orders for almost
a universal admission of American articles, before we
even know that any vessel from Great Britain will find admission
into any American ports. What do we ask in
return? No more than this; that while we gratuitously,
and without stipulation, give advantages and favors to the
American States, which we deny to all other nations, they
would so far justify our liberal way of proceeding, as to
receive us in the same manner as other nations, which are
foreign, and to permit us to carry to North America, what
it is evidently for their interest that we should carry
thither.</p>

<p>I need hardly add, that it is of infinite importance, that
some temporary convention should be finished without loss
of time. I hope and trust that we shall not find much
more difficulty in this business. You must see the advantage
of an immediate renewal of intercourse, and from the
candor of your dispositions, I am sure you must likewise
be convinced, that to give us some facility in the outset, is
the sure road to such an equitable arrangement for the
future, as you must have at heart. The reasons, which I
have given in the Memorial appear to me to be cogent and
convincing, upon the natural alliance between our two
countries. And when the intercourse has once begun,
everything will go in its natural road. It is, therefore,
of infinite consequence to begin that intercourse. Great
Britain, by all public proceedings of repeals, proclamations,
&amp;c. &amp;c. has made the first advances, with warmth
and confidence, and, therefore, I conclude, with the fullest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
assurance, that you will meet those advances with cordial
reciprocity.</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY'S MEMORIAL TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p>The proposition, which has been made for a universal
and unlimited reciprocity of intercourse and commerce,
between Great Britain and the American United States,
requires a very serious consideration on the part of Great
Britain, for the reasons already stated in a Memorial, dated
May 19th, 1783, and for many other reasons, which in the
future discussion of the proposition will appear. To the
American States, likewise, it is a matter of the deepest
importance, not only as a proposition of commercial intercourse,
which is the least part, but most principally, as a
political basis and guarantee for their newly established
constitutions. The introduction of British interests into
a communion of intercourse, will bring forward a universal
guarantee on the part of Great Britain, in the future
progress of political events, which may affect the United
States of America in their national capacity. The proposition
is fertile in future prospects to Great Britain; and
America also may wisely see in it a solid foundation for
herself.</p>

<p>All circumstances are most fortunately disposed between
Great Britain and the American States, to render them
useful friends and allies to each other, with a higher degree
of suitableness between themselves than any other
nations can pretend to. France cannot interchange reciprocities
with the American States, by reason of numberless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
impediments in her system of government, in her monopolies,
and her system of commerce. France has the
great disability of difference in language to contend with;
and the institution of the present French manufactures has
never, at any time heretofore, been trained or adapted to
American commerce. The only particular and pacific facility
which France ever possessed for American intercourse,
has for many years been transferred into the British scale
by the cession of Canada to Great Britain. The future
commerce, between France and America, will chiefly be
regulated by such conveniences as France can draw to
herself from America, without much aptitude on the part
of France, to accommodate her manufactures and commerce
to American demands. In short, an interchange
of reciprocities between France and America, would run
against the stream on both sides; and all established habits,
manners, language, together with the principles of government
and commerce, would militate against such a system.</p>

<p>Conformably to this reasoning, it appears, that France
has not at any time entertained any systematical design of
forming any union or consolidation of interests with America.
She took up the American cause, as instrumental
to her political views in Europe. America likewise accepted
the alliance with France, for her separate views,
viz. for the establishment of her independence. The alliance,
therefore, is completed and terminated, without leaving
behind it any political principle of future permanent
connexion between them. Occasional circumstances produced
a temporary alliance. Similar circumstances
may, on any future occasion, produce a similar event of a
temporary compact. Dissimilar circumstances, arising
from any future political views of the Court of France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
in Europe, may without any inconsistency of principle,
throw the power of that kingdom into a scale adverse to
the future interests of the American States. In such case,
therefore, where there cannot exist any permanent political
connexion between France and America, and where the
commercial attachments can be but feeble, it would be
vain to expect in the French nation any such ally, as newly
established States ought to look out for, to give maturity
and firmness to their constitutions.</p>

<p>As to Spain, every argument which has been stated
respecting diversity of language, manners, government,
monopolies, and system of commerce, from those which
prevail in the United States of America, obtains in a superior
degree. And much more to add besides, for Spain
is not only incompetent to interchange reciprocities with
the American States, but likewise her own situation in
America will at all times render her extremely jealous of
her neighbors. The only activity which Spain has exerted
in the war, has been to procure a barrier against the
American States, by annexing West Florida to her former
acquisition of New Orleans; thereby embracing the mouth
of the Mississippi, and by means of that river, jointly with
her landed possessions, establishing a strong and jealous
boundary against any future progress of the American
States in those parts. Spain, therefore, cannot be looked
upon by the American States as a suitable object of their
election, to become a permanent ally and friend to them.
Portugal, likewise, labors under all the disabilities of language,
manners, monopolies, government and system of
commerce. Her national power and importance would
be likewise insufficient to constitute a strong and permanent
ally to the American States. All these nations will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
undoubtedly be found to have many commodious qualities
for participation in commerce; but the permanent facilities
necessary to constitute a firm and permanent ally to the
American States, will be found deficient in them.</p>

<p>As to the Italian States, or any other powers in the
Mediterranean, they are certainly not adequate to any
competition of political alliance with the rising States of
America. They will also form very commodious links
and connexions in the general circuit of commerce; but
beyond these considerations, they have no share in the
present question. The several States in the Germanic
body are in the same predicament.</p>

<p>As to the Northern powers, viz. those in the Baltic, they
are not favored either by vicinity, or climate, for a frequent
or facile intercourse of commerce with America.
And even respecting several material articles of commerce,
jealousies and competitions might arise. As to political
alliances, there are no such in prospect from them to the
American States. Even if there were any superfluity of
force in any of them beyond the necessities of their respective
domestic situations, the extreme distance would
be conclusive against any possible application of such
power, as a political alliance favorable to the establishment
and conformation of the American States.</p>

<p>The only maritime state on the continent of Europe remaining
to be discussed, as a competent candidate for
commerce, or connexion with America, is the Republic
of the United Netherlands, commonly called Holland. In
respect to American commerce, the Dutch have among
themselves every facility combined, which the separate
States of Europe, possess distinctly in their own concerns,
or nearly. Their industry, frugality, and habits of commerce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
may even carry them so far, as to make them
rivals to the Americans themselves, in the transportation of
European merchandise to America. These faculties of
commerce would have been of infinite importance to the
American States, if the war had continued between Great
Britain and them. But upon the event of peace, it becomes
a matter of the most perfect indifference to America,
whether each European State navigates its own commerce
into the ports of America, which will open to all,
or whether the commercial faculties of Holland enable her
to exceed in rivalship her European neighbors, and thereby
to navigate European goods to America beyond the
proportion of her national share. The faculties of a nation
of carriers may be fortunate for the marine of that nation;
but considered in themselves, and with respect to other
nations, they are but secondaries in commerce. They
give no ground of reciprocities, or participation. That
one nation should say to another, you shall navigate all our
rivers, harbors, lakes, ports, and places, if we may do the
same in yours, is a proposition of reciprocity; but that
Holland should say to America, we will bring European
goods to you, or you may be your own carriers, is neither
concession nor reciprocity. Holland is not a nation of
rivers, harbors, lakes, ports, and places, for the distribution
of goods and manufactures for internal consumption, and,
therefore, her reciprocities must be very scanty. Holland
is the market-place of Europe, and the Dutch seamen
are the carriers appertaining to that market-place. The
admission of American ships to that market-place, freely to
import and to export, is, undoubtedly, an act of reciprocity
on the part of Holland as far as it goes, but in no degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
adequate to the unlimited participation of American commerce
throughout the rivers, harbors, lakes, ports, and
places of that vast continent. The commercial reciprocities
of Holland, therefore, being inferior, on her part,
towards America, the next point of view in which Holland
is to be considered, as relevant to this question, is, as a
nation of power, capable of becoming an effectual and permanent
ally and guarantee to the American States, for
that is the great object, which America, as a wise nation,
recently arisen into independence, ought to keep in view.
Holland has certainly been a nation of great and celebrated
naval force. She remains so still; but having for
many years suspended her exertions of force, and having
directed the faculties of her people into the commercial
line, she seems not to have any superfluity of force beyond
the necessity of providing for her own security; and, certainly,
no such redundance of power, as to extend to the
protection of distant nations, as allies or guarantees. It
appears, therefore, upon the whole of this argument, that
Holland, although a commercial nation, cannot even interchange
commercial reciprocities with America upon an
equal footing, and that her faculties of force are inadequate
to those, which America ought to expect in the permanent
allies and guarantees of her country.</p>

<p>The independence of the American States being established,
their first consideration ought to be, to determine
with what friendships and alliances they will enter into the
new world of nations. They will look round them, and
cast about for some natural, permanent, and powerful ally,
with whom they may interchange all cementing reciprocities,
both commercial and political. If such an ally be to
be found anywhere for them, it is still in Great Britain; at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
least, it is certain, that, in looking round Europe, no other
is to be found. There is no inherent impossibility to prevent
such a connexion from taking place; it must depend
on the free will and common interest of the parties.
There are all possible faculties on both sides, to give and
to receive all adequate and beneficial reciprocities, which
are practicable and more likely to be permanent between
independent parties, than between two parties, of which
one is dependent on the other. Great Britain is, undoubtedly,
the first of European nations, in riches, credit, faculties,
industry, commerce, manufactures, internal consumption,
and foreign export, together with civil liberty, which
is the source of all, and naval power, which is the support
of all. The dominions appertaining to the Crown of
Great Britain are large and fertile; its Colonies still extensive,
and in close vicinity to the American States, Great
Britain being an American, as well as an European power,
and all her empire connected by her naval force.</p>

<p>The territories of the American States, from the Atlantic
ocean to the Mississippi, contain an inexhaustible source
of riches, industry, and future power. These will be the
foundations of great events in the new page of life. Infinite
good, or infinite evil, may arise according to the
principles upon which the intercourse between Great
Britain and America shall be arranged in its foundation.
Great Britain and America must be still inseparable, either
as friends or foes. This is an awful and important truth.
These are considerations not to be thought of slightly;
not to be prejudged in passion, nor the arrangements of
them to be hastily foreclosed. Time given for consideration
may have excellent effects on both sides. The pause
of peace, with friendly intercourse, returning affection, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
dispassionate inquiry, can alone decide these important
events, or do justice to the anxious expectations of Great
Britain and America.</p>

<h3>THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, June 16th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you, that by the resignation of Mr
Livingston as Minister for Foreign Affairs, it has become
necessary that you should receive the resolutions of Congress,
relative to your mission through my hands. The
disadvantage arising from this necessity, until a successor
to that worthy gentleman is appointed, will be yours, as it
is impossible for me to do more than barely to transmit the
acts of Congress necessary for your information.</p>

<p>Enclosed you have one of the 1st of May last, and
another of the 12th instant, which I hope will get safe to
hand time enough for your government. The commission
and instructions referred to in the first, not being ready, it
was thought best to forward the resolution without delay,
that you might know what was intended in the present important
period of your negotiation. We have been much
surprised, that we have not received any communications
from you since the cessation of hostilities, except a letter
of the 5th of April, from Mr Laurens.</p>

<h3>HENRY LAURENS TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">London, June 17th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I had the honor of addressing you on the 10th, immediately
after my landing at Dover. As early as possible
after my arrival here, I obtained an interview with Mr
Secretary Fox, who was pleased to read to me part of his
latest despatches to Mr Hartley, which he supposed would
reach Paris on the 14th. It is probable, therefore, that
before this time, as much of the contents as is proper for
your knowledge has been communicated.</p>

<p>"Reciprocity," since the 10th of April, has undergone
a certain degree of refinement. The definition of that
term appears now to be possession of advantages on one
side, and restrictions on the other. "The navigation act
is the vital of Great Britain, too delicate to bear a touch."
The sudden and unexpected, perhaps illicit, arrival of
ships and cargoes from America, may have caused this
change of tone. But you have heard in detail, and are
more competent to judge.</p>

<p>From a desire of forming an opinion, I asked Mr Fox,
whether he thought I might venture for a few days, to take
the benefit of Bath, and yet be in time enough at Paris
for the intended commercial agreement? He replied, "I
rather think you may." One need not be a conjurer to
draw an inference; you will either have finished the business
before I could travel to Paris, or without being missed
there I may go to Bath and repair my nerves.</p>

<p>In this state of uncertainty, when it is easy to perceive
affections are not as we could wish them, nor quite so warm
as we had been taught to believe, it would not be wise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
commit the United States; wherefore I shall rest the business
till I hear from you, or until a more favorable prospect;
flattering myself with hopes of your surmounting the
late seeming difficulties. An inconvenience on your side is
preferable to the hazard of a disgrace.</p>

<h3>THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, June 18th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor of enclosing you an official letter, directed
to our Ministers Plenipotentiary at Paris.</p>

<p>The resignation of the late Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
(occasioned by his preference of the Chancellorship of
the State of New York, which he could not hold longer
and retain his Secretaryship,) has cast the business of his
office on me, till a successor is elected, which I hope will
speedily take place.</p>

<p>As part of the resolution of Congress of the 12th instant,
enclosed in that letter, is of a secret nature, I have written
it in cyphers, but not having that of Mr Livingston's, I
thought it best to use Mr Morris's to you, which he has
obligingly supplied me with; so that the Ministers will be
indebted for your decyphering it.</p>

<p>Your letter to Mr Livingston of the 15th of April, enclosing
the two medals, came to hand this morning. I am
sorry to find, that you have cause for similar complaints to
those we have been making for two months past, on the
subject of want of intelligence. We have not heard from
any of our Commissioners at Paris, since February, excepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
a letter from Mr Laurens, though our anxiety and
expectations have been wound up to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>I feel myself much indebted for your polite compliment
of the medal; it is thought very elegant, and the device
and workmanship much admired. You will be pleased,
Sir, to accept my acknowledgments on this occasion. As
I doubt not but the copper one was designed for Mr Livingston
personally, I shall send it to him by the first convenient
opportunity. He is a worthy deserving character,
and the United States will suffer greatly by his resignation,
though I think him justified in attending to the calls of his
private affairs.</p>

<p>You will receive herewith a number of our late newspapers,
in which are inserted many resolves, associations,
&amp;c. from all parts of the country, which I earnestly
wish could be kept out of sight. But the truth is, that
the cruelties, ravages, and barbarisms of the refugees and
loyalists, have left the people so sore, that it is not yet time
for them to exercise their good sense and cooler judgment.
And that cannot take place, while the citizens of New
York are kept out of their city, and despoiled daily of
their property, by the sending off their negroes by hundreds,
in the face of the treaty. It has been exceedingly
ill judged in the British to retain New York so long, and
to persist in sending away the negroes, as it has irritated
the citizens of America to an alarming degree.</p>

<p class="letter_head">London, June 20th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Permit me to refer to what I had the honor of writing
to you the 17th. You will recollect my suggestions, as
soon as we perceived the falling off from those warm assurances,
which had been pressed in March and April.
They were not ill founded. I delayed a week in hopes
of intelligence, and left you with reluctance; the temper
of the times forbids even an essay.</p>

<p>What a happy country is this, where everything pertaining
to the public is rendered to them in public newspapers.
See the enclosed, containing nearly as accurate an
account of certain recent occurrences, as if it had been
penned by one of the parties. It might indeed have been
made a little stronger. Modest men are sometimes restrained
from attempting a public good, from a dread of
the effects of envy, of being held up in an invidious light.
It would be cruel to disturb them.</p>

<p>I have heard nothing from America, save what you may
have read in the prints. Tomorrow I shall proceed to
Bath, and be waiting for intelligence, as well from yourselves
as from Congress. Some consolation arises from
reflecting, that while I am endeavoring to mend my health,

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Passy, June 28th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Mr Grand, banker to the Congress, having laid before
us the annexed state of their affairs in his hands,
we conceive ourselves indispensably obliged to communicate
the same to your Excellency, as some important
interests of both countries are concerned.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Before the peace was known in America, and while
Mr Morris had hopes of obtaining the five per cent
duty and a larger loan from his Majesty, the immediate
urgent necessities of the army obliged him to draw
bills, and sell them to the merchants, to raise money
for the purchase of provisions, to prevent their starving
or disbanding.</p>

<p>The merchants have thereupon formed their plans
of business, and remitted those bills to their correspondents
here, to pay debts, and purchase goods in this
kingdom, to be carried home in the ships, that are
come, or coming to France, thus to open a larger
commerce with this nation.</p>

<p>If those bills cannot be paid, the creditors of America
will be disappointed and greatly hurt, and the
commerce will be deranged and discouraged in its
first operations, of which the numerous ill consequences
are more easily imagined than described.</p>

<p>Our loan in Holland is going on, and with such
prospect of success, that the bankers, who have the
care of it, have lately sent by express to Mr Adams
all the blank obligations, necessary to complete it, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
him to sign, that they might have them ready to deliver,
as demanded, his return thither being delayed.</p>

<p>This loan will, therefore, probably answer the bills
Mr Morris has drawn on those bankers.</p>

<p>But the protesting any of his bills here would occasion
such an alarm there, as must probably entirely
stop any further progress of that loan, and thereby increase
the mischief.</p>

<p>The government of the Congress would also be enfeebled
by it.</p>

<p>We apprehend, too, that, in the present unsettled
situation of our affairs with England, such a failure
might have very ill effects, with respect to our negotiations.</p>

<p>We therefore request your counsel, hoping your
wisdom, which has so often befriended our nation,
may point out some way, by which we may be extricated
from this distress.</p>

<p>And as the King has hitherto so generously assisted
us, we hope that, if it is any way practicable, his Majesty
will crown the glorious work, by affording us
this help, at the different periods when it will be
wanted, and which is absolutely the last that will be

<h3>PROPOSITIONS MADE BY THE COMMISSIONERS TO DAVID
HARTLEY FOR THE DEFINITIVE TREATY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Article i.</span> To omit in the definitive treaty the
exception, at the end of the second Article of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
provisional treaty, viz. these words, "excepting such
islands as now are, or heretofore have been within the
limits of the said Province of Nova Scotia."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article ii.</span> The prisoners made respectively, by
the arms of his Britannic Majesty, and the United
States, by sea and by land, not already set at liberty,
shall be restored reciprocally and <i>bona fide</i>, immediately
after the ratification of the definitive treaty, without
ransom, and on paying the debts they may have
contracted during their captivity; and each party shall
respectively reimburse the sums, which shall have
been advanced, for the subsistence and maintenance of
the prisoners, by the sovereign of the country where
they shall have been detained, according to the receipts
and attested accounts, and other authentic titles,
which shall be produced on each side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article iii.</span> His Britannic Majesty shall employ
his good offices and interposition with the King or
Emperor of Morocco or Fez, the Regencies of Algiers,
Tunis and Tripoli, or with any of them, and also with
every other Prince, State or power of the coast of
Barbary, in Africa, and the subjects of the said King,
Emperor, States and powers and each of them, in order
to provide as fully and efficaciously as possible for
the benefit, conveniency and safety of the said United
States and each of them, their subjects, people and inhabitants,
and their vessels and effects, against all violence,
insult, attacks or depredations on the part of
the said Princes and States of Barbary, or their
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article iv.</span> If war should hereafter arise between
Great Britain and the United States, which God forbid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the merchants of either country then residing in
the other, shall be allowed to remain nine months to
collect their debts and settle their affairs, and may
depart freely, carrying off all their effects without
molestation or hinderance. And all fishermen, all cultivators
of the earth, and all artisans and manufacturers
unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages
or places, who labor for the common subsistence and
benefit of mankind, and peaceably follow their respective
employments, shall be allowed to continue the
same, and shall not be molested by the armed
force of the enemy in whose power, by the events of
war, they may happen to fall; but if anything is necessary
to be taken from them, for the use of such
armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable
price. And all merchants or traders with their unarmed
vessels employed in commerce, exchanging the
products of different places and thereby rendering the
necessaries, conveniences and comforts of human life
more easy to obtain, and more general, shall be allowed
to pass freely unmolested. And neither of the
powers, parties to this treaty, shall grant or issue any
commission, to any private armed vessels, empowering
them to take or destroy such trading ships, or interrupt
such commerce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article v.</span> And in case either of the contracting
parties, shall happen to be engaged in war with any
other nation, it is further agreed, in order to prevent
all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually
arise respecting the merchandise heretofore called contraband,
such as arms, ammunition, and military stores
of all kinds, that no such articles carrying by the ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
or subjects of one of the parties to the enemies of the
other, shall on any account be deemed contraband, so
as to induce confiscation and a loss of property to
individuals. Nevertheless, it shall be lawful to stop
such ships and detain them for such length of time as
the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconveniences
or damage that might ensue from their proceeding
on their voyage, paying, however, a reasonable
compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion
to the proprietors. And it shall further be allowed to
use in the service of the captors, the whole or any
part of the military stores so detained, paying to the
owners the full value of the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vi.</span> The citizens and inhabitants of the
said United States, or any of them, may take and hold
real estates in Great Britain, Ireland, or any other of
his Majesty's dominions, and dispose by testaments,
donations or otherwise of their property, real or personal,
in favor of such person as to them shall seem
fit; and their heirs, citizens of the said United States,
or any of them residing in the British dominions or
elsewhere, may succeed them <i>ab intestato</i>, without being
obliged to obtain letters of naturalization. The
subjects of his Britannic Majesty shall enjoy on their
parts, in all the dominions of the said United States,
an entire and perfect reciprocity, relative to the stipulations
contained in the present Article.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article vii.</span> The ratifications of the definitive
treaty shall be expedited in good and due form, and
exchanged in the space of five months, or sooner if it
can be done, to be computed from the day of the signature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article viii.</span> Query. Whether the King of
Great Britain will admit the citizens of the United
States to cut logwood on the district allotted to his
Majesty by Spain, and on what terms?</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY'S SIX PROPOSITIONS FOR A DEFINITIVE
TREATY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">June, 1783.</p>

<p>1st. That lands belonging to persons of any description,
which have not actually been sold, shall be restored
to the old possessors without price.</p>

<p>2dly. That an equal and free participation of the
different carrying places, and the navigation of all the lakes
and rivers of that country, through which the water line of
division passes between Canada and the United States,
shall be enjoyed fully and uninterruptedly by both parties.</p>

<p>3dly. That in any such places, within the boundaries
assigned generally to the American States, as are adjoining
to the water line of division, and which are not specifically
under the dominion of any one State, all persons at present
resident, or having possessions or occupations as merchants,
or otherwise, may remain in peaceable enjoyment
of all civil rights, and in pursuit of their respective occupations.</p>

<p>4thly. That in any such places adjoining to the water
line of division, as may be under the specific dominion of
any particular State, all persons at present resident, or
having possessions or occupations as merchants, or otherwise,
may remain in the peaceable enjoyment of all civil
rights, and in pursuit of their occupations, until they shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
receive notice of removal from the State to which any
such place may appertain; and, upon any such notice of
removal, a term of three years shall be allowed for selling,
or withdrawing their valuable effects, and for settling their
affairs.</p>

<p>5thly. That his Britannic Majesty's forces, not
exceeding &mdash;&mdash; in number, may continue in the posts
now occupied by them contiguous to the water line, for
the term of three years, for the purpose of securing the
lives, property, and peace of any persons settled in that
country, against the invasion or ravages of the neighboring
Indian nations, who may be suspected of retaining
resentments, in consequence of the late war.</p>

<p>6thly. That no tax or impost whatsoever, shall be laid
on any articles of commerce passing or repassing through
the country, but that the trade may be left entirely open,
for the benefit of all parties interested therein.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<h3>THE COMMISSIONERS' ANSWERS TO MR HARTLEY'S SIX
PROPOSITIONS.</h3>

<p>To the 1st. This matter has been already regulated in
the 5th and 6th Articles of the Provisional Treaty, to the
utmost extent of our powers. The rest must be left to
the several States.</p>

<p>2dly. All the lakes, rivers, and waters, divided by
the boundary line, or lines, between the United States and
his Britannic Majesty's territories, shall be freely used and
navigated by both parties, during the whole extent of such
divisions. Regulations concerning roads, carrying places,
and any land communications between said waters, whether
within the line of the United States or that of his Majesty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
together with the navigation of all waters and rivers in
America, belonging to either party, may be made in a negotiation
of a treaty of commerce.</p>

<p>3dly. That in all places belonging to the United
States, in the country adjoining to the water line of division,
and which, during the war, were in his Majesty's possession,
all persons at present resident, or having possessions
or occupations as merchants, or otherwise, may
remain in the peaceable enjoyment of all civil rights, and
in pursuit of their occupations, until they shall receive notice
of removal from Congress, or the State to which any
such place may appertain; and that upon any such notice
of removal, a term of two years shall be allowed for selling,
or withdrawing their effects, and for settling their
affairs.</p>

<p>4thly. That his Britannic Majesty's forces, not
exceeding &mdash;&mdash; in number, may continue in the
posts now occupied by them contiguous to the water line,
until Congress shall give them notice to evacuate the said
posts, and garrisons of their own shall arrive at said posts,
for the purpose of securing the lives, property, and peace
of any persons settled in that country, against the invasion
or ravages of the neighboring Indian nations, who may be
suspected of retaining resentments, in consequence of the
late war.</p>

<p>5thly. The consideration of this proposition may be
left to the treaty of commerce.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Passy, July 17th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have the honor to inform you, that we have just received
from Congress, their ratification in due form, of the
Provisional Articles of the 30th of November, 1782, and
we are ready to exchange ratifications with his Britannic
Majesty's Ministers as soon as may be.</p>

<p>By the same Articles it is stipulated, that his Britannic
Majesty shall, with all convenient speed, and without
causing any destruction, or carrying away any negroes, or
other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all
his armies, garrisons, and fleets from the United States,
and from every port, place, and harbor within the same.
But, by intelligence lately received from America, and by
the enclosed copies of letters and conferences between
General Washington and Sir Guy Carleton, it appears that
a considerable number of negroes, belonging to the citizens
of the United States, have been carried off from New
York, contrary to the express stipulation contained in the
said Article. We have received from Congress their instructions
to represent this matter to you, and to request
that speedy and effectual measures be taken to render
that justice to the parties interested, which the true
intent and meaning of the Article in question plainly
dictates.</p>

<p>We are also instructed to represent to you, that many
of the British debtors in America have, in the course of
the war, sustained such considerable and heavy losses by
the operations of the British arms in that country, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
great number of them have been rendered incapable of
immediately satisfying those debts; we refer it to the
justice and equity of Great Britain, so far to amend the
Article on that subject, as that no execution shall be issued
on a judgment to be obtained in any such case, but after
the expiration of three years from the date of the definitive
treaty of peace. Congress also think it reasonable,
that such part of the interest, which may have accrued on
such debts during the war, shall not be payable, because
all intercourse between the two countries had, during that
period, become impracticable, as well as improper. It
does not appear just, that individuals in America should
pay for delays in payment, which were occasioned by the
civil and military measures of Great Britain. In our
opinion, the interest of the creditors as well as the debtors,
requires that some tenderness be shown to the latter, and
that they should be allowed a little time to acquire the
means of discharging debts, which, in many instances,
exceed the whole amount of their property.</p>

<p>As it is necessary to ascertain an epocha for the restitutions
and evacuations to be made, we propose, that it be
agreed, that his Britannic Majesty shall cause to be evacuated
the posts of New York, Penobscot, and their dependencies
with all other posts and places in possession of his
Majesty's arms within the United States, in the space of
three months after the signature of the definitive treaty, or
sooner, if possible, excepting those posts contiguous to the
water line, mentioned in the 4th proposition, and those
shall be evacuated when Congress shall give the notice
therein mentioned.</p>

<p>We do ourselves the honor of making these communications
to you, Sir, that you may transmit them, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
papers accompanying them, to your Court, and inform
us of their answer.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Passy, July 18th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have had the honor of receiving by Captain
Barney your two letters of the 25th of March and
21st of April, with the papers referred to in them.</p>

<p>We are happy to find, that the Provisional Articles
have been approved and ratified by Congress, and we
regret, that the manner in which that business was
conducted, does not coincide with your ideas of propriety.
We are persuaded, however, that this is
principally owing to your being necessarily unacquainted
with a number of circumstances, known to
us, who were on the spot, and which will be particularly
explained to you hereafter, and, we trust, to
your satisfaction, and that of the Congress.</p>

<p>Your doubts respecting the Separate Article, we
think, are capable of being removed; but as a full
state of the reasons and circumstances, which prompted
that measure, would be very prolix, we shall
content ourselves with giving you the general outlines.</p>

<p>Mr Oswald was desirous to cover as much of the
eastern shores of the Mississippi with British claims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
as possible; and, for this purpose, we were told a
great deal about the ancient bounds of Canada, Louisiana,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The British Court, who had, probably,
not yet adopted the idea of relinquishing the Floridas,
seemed desirous of annexing as much territory to them
as possible, even up to the mouth of the Ohio. Mr
Oswald adhered strongly to that object, as well to render
the British countries there of sufficient extent to
be (as he expressed it) worth keeping and protecting,
as to afford a convenient retreat to the tories, for
whom it would be difficult otherwise to provide; and,
among other arguments, he finally urged his being
willing to yield to our demands to the east, north, and
west, as a further reason for our gratifying him on the
point in question. He also produced the commission
of Governor Johnson, extending the bounds of his
government of West Florida, up to the river Yazoo;
and contended for that extent as a matter of right,
upon various principles, which, however, we did not
admit, the King not being authorised, in our opinion
to extend or contract the bounds of the colonies at
pleasure.</p>

<p>We were of opinion, that the country in contest was
of great value, both on account of its natural fertility
and of its position, it being, in our opinion, the interest
of America to extend as far down towards the
mouth of the Mississippi as we possibly could. We
also thought it advisable to impress Britain with a
strong sense of the importance of the navigation of that
river to their future commerce on the interior waters,
from the mouth of the St Lawrence to that of the
Mississippi, and thereby render that Court averse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
any stipulations with Spain to relinquish it. These
two objects militated against each other, because to
enhance the value of the navigation, was also to enhance
the value of the countries contiguous to it, and
thereby disincline Britain to the dereliction of them.
We thought, therefore, that the surest way to reconcile
and obtain both objects would be by a composition
beneficial to both parties. We therefore proposed,
that Britain should withdraw her pretensions to all the
country above the Yazoo, and that we would cede all
below it to her, in case she should have the Floridas
at the end of the war; and, at all events, that she
should have a right to navigate the river throughout
its whole extent. This proposition was accepted, and
we agreed to insert the contingent fact of it in a separate
Article, for the express purpose of keeping it secret
for the present. That Article ought not, therefore,
to be considered as a mere matter of favor to
Britain, but as the result of a bargain, in which that
Article was a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</p>

<p>It was in our opinion, both necessary and justifiable,
to keep this Article secret. The negotiations between
Spain, France, and Britain were then in full
vigor, and embarrassed by a variety of clashing demands.
The publication of this Article would have
irritated Spain, and retarded, if not have prevented
her coming to an agreement with Britain.</p>

<p>Had we mentioned it to the French Minister, he
must have not only informed Spain of it, but also been
obliged to act a part respecting it, that would probably
have been disagreeable to America; and he certainly
has reason to rejoice that our silence saved him
that delicate and disagreeable task.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>This was an Article, in which France had not the
smallest interest, nor is there anything in her treaty
with us, that restrains us from making what bargain
we please with Britain about those or any other lands,
without rendering account of such transaction to her
or any other power whatever. The same observation
applies with still greater force to Spain; and neither
justice nor honor forbid us to dispose as we pleased of
our own lands without her knowledge or consent.
Spain at that very time extended her pretensions and
claims of dominion, not only over the tract in question
but over the vast region lying between the Floridas
and Lake Superior; and this Court was also, at that
very time, soothing and nursing those pretensions by
a proposed conciliatory line for splitting the difference.
Suppose, therefore, we had offered this tract to Spain,
in case she retained the Floridas, should we even have
had thanks for it? or would it have abated the chagrin
she experienced from being disappointed in her
extravagant and improper designs on that whole country?
We think not.</p>

<p>We perfectly concur with you in sentiment, Sir,
that "<i>honesty is the best policy</i>." But, until it be shown
that we have trespassed on the rights of any man, or
body of men, you must excuse our thinking that this
remark as applied to our proceedings was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Should any explanations, either with France or
Spain become necessary on this subject, we hope and
expect to meet with no embarrassment. We shall
neither amuse them nor perplex ourselves with flimsy
excuses, but tell them plainly, that it was not our
duty to give them the information; we considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
ourselves at liberty to withhold it. And we shall remind
the French Minister that he has more reason to
be pleased than displeased with our silence. Since
we have assumed a place in the political system of the
world, let us move like a primary and not like a secondary
planet.</p>

<p>We are persuaded, Sir, that your remarks on these
subjects resulted from real opinion and were made
with candor and sincerity. The best men will view
objects of this kind in different lights even when
standing on the same ground; and it is not to be
wondered at, that we, who are on the spot and have
the whole transaction under our eyes, should see many
parts of it in a stronger point of light, than persons
at a distance, who can only view it through the dull
medium of representation.</p>

<p>It would give us great pain if anything we have
written or now write respecting this Court should be
construed to impeach the friendship of the King and
nation for us. We also believe that the Minister is so
far our friend, and is disposed so far to do us good
offices, as may correspond with, and be dictated by his
system of policy for promoting the power, riches, and
glory of France. God forbid that we should ever
sacrifice our faith, our gratitude, or our honor, to any
considerations of convenience; and may He also forbid
that we should ever be unmindful of the dignity
and independent spirit, which should always characterize
a free and generous people.</p>

<p>We shall immediately propose an Article to be inserted
in the definitive treaty for postponing the payment
of British debts for the time mentioned by Congress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>There are, no doubt, certain ambiguities in our Articles,
but it is not to be wondered at, when it is considered how
exceedingly averse Britain was to any expressions, which
explicitly wounded the tories; and how disinclined we were
to use any, that should amount to absolute stipulations
in their favor.</p>

<p>The words for returning the property of <i>real British
subjects</i> were well understood and explained between us,
<i>not</i> to mean or comprehend <i>American refugees</i>. Mr Oswald
and Mr Fitzherbert know this to have been the case,
and will readily confess and admit it. This mode of expression
was preferred by them, as a more delicate mode
of excluding those refugees, and of making a proper distinction
between them and the subjects of Britain, whose
only particular interest in America consisted in holding
lands or property there.</p>

<p>The 6th Article, viz. where it declares, that no <i>future
confiscations</i> shall be made, &amp;c. ought to have fixed the time
with greater accuracy. We think the most fair and true
construction is, that it relates to the date of the cessation of
hostilities. That is the time when peace in fact took
place, in consequence of prior informal, though binding,
contracts to terminate the war. We consider the definitive
treaties, as only giving the dress of form to those contracts,
and not as constituting the obligation of them. Had
the cessation of hostilities been the effect of truce, and consequently
nothing more than a temporary suspension of
war, another construction would have been the true one.</p>

<p>We are officially assured by Mr Hartley, that positive
orders for the evacuation of New York have been despatched,
and that no avoidable delay will retard that event.
Had we proposed to fix a time for it, the British Commissioner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
would have contended, that it should be a time posterior
to the date of the definitive treaty, and that would
have been probably more disadvantageous to us, than as
that Article now stands.</p>

<p>We are surprised to hear, that any doubts have arisen
in America, respecting the time when the cessation of hostilities
took place there. It most certainly took place at
the expiration of one month after the date of that declaration,
in all parts of the world, whether by land or sea, that
lay north of the latitude of the Canaries.</p>

<p>The ships afterwards taken from us, in the more northerly
latitudes, ought to be reclaimed and given up. We
shall apply to Mr Hartley on this subject, and also on
that of the transportation of negroes from New York, contrary
to the words and intention of the provisional articles.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Paris, July 27th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The definitive treaties between the late belligerent powers
are none of them yet completed. Ours has gone on
slowly, owing partly to the necessity Mr Hartley, successor
of Mr Oswald, thinks himself under of sending every proposition,
either his own or ours, to his Court for their approbation,
and their delay in answering, through negligence
perhaps, since they have heard our ports are open, or
through indecision, occasioned by ignorance of the subject,
or through want of union among the Ministers. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
send you herewith copies of several papers, that have
passed between us. He has for some time assured us, that
he is in hourly expectation of answers, but they do not
arrive. The British Proclamation, respecting the commerce,
appears to vex him a good deal. We enclose a
copy. And we are of opinion, that finally we shall find
it best to drop all commercial articles in our definitive
treaty, and leave everything of that kind to a future special
treaty, to be made either in America or in Europe, as
Congress shall think fit to order. Perhaps it may be best
to give powers for that purpose to the Minister, that probably
will be sent to London. The opinion here is, that it
will be becoming in us to take the first step towards the
mutual exchange of Ministers, and we have been assured
by the English Minister, who treats with us here, that ours
will be well received.</p>

<p>The Dutch preliminaries are not yet agreed on, and it
seems to be settled, that we are to sign all together, in the
presence of the Ministers of the two Imperial Courts, who
are to be complimented with the opportunity of signing as
mediators, though they have not yet, and perhaps will not
be consulted in the negotiations. Mr Adams has gone to
Holland for three weeks, but will return sooner if wanted.
The propositions you mention, as made to us from that
State, we suppose he has given you an account of. Nothing
was, or is likely to be, done upon them here, and
therefore it was less necessary to say anything concerning
them. A Minister from thence has been gone some time
to Congress, and if he has those propositions in charge,
they will best be considered there.</p>

between his Britannic Majesty and the United

<p>Be it known to all those, to whom it shall or may in any

<p>It has pleased the Most High to diffuse the spirit of
union and concord among the nations, whose divisions had
spread troubles in the four parts of the world, and to inspire
them with the inclination to cause the comforts of
peace, to succeed to the misfortunes of a long and bloody
war, which having arisen between Great Britain and the
United States of America, in its progress communicated
itself to France, Spain, and the United Netherlands.</p>

<p>Consequently the United States of America, did, on the
fifteenth of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and eightyone, name and appoint their
Ministers Plenipotentiary, and resolve, ordain, and grant
their Commission in the following words, viz. [See
page <a href="#Page_71">71</a>.]</p>

<p>And his Majesty, the King of Great Britain, did on the
twentyfirst day of September, in the twentysecond year
of his reign, issue his Commission, under the great seal
of Great Britain, to Richard Oswald, in the words following,
viz. [See page <a href="#Page_80">80</a>.]</p>

<p>And his said Britannic Majesty, on the one part, and
the said United States of America on the other, did lay
the foundations of peace in the preliminaries, signed at
Paris, on the thirtieth of November last, by the said Richard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Oswald, on the part of his said Majesty, and by the
said John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and
Henry Laurens, on the part of the said United States, in
virtue of their respective full powers aforesaid, and after
having mutually shown to each other their said full powers
in good form, and mutually exchanged authenticated
copies of the same.</p>

<p>And his said Britannic Majesty did, on the twentyfourth
day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand, seven
hundred and eightytwo, and in the twentysecond year of his
reign, issue his Commission, signed with his royal hand, and
under the great seal of Great Britain, to Alleyne Fitzherbert,
in the following words, viz. [Here follows the Commission.]</p>

<p>And the said Alleyne Fitzherbert, on the part of his said
Britannic Majesty, and John Adams and Benjamin Franklin,
in the necessary absence of the said John Jay and Henry
Laurens, on the part of the said United States, did, at Versailles,
on the twentieth day of January last, communicate
to each other their full powers aforesaid, in good form, and
agreed upon an armistice in the words following; [See
pp. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>, <a href="#Page_123">123</a>.]</p>

<p>And his Britannic Majesty did on the &mdash;&mdash;
day of &mdash;&mdash; in the year of our Lord, one
thousand seven hundred and eightythree, and in the
twentythird year of his reign, issue his Commission, signed
with his royal hand, and under the great seal of Great
Britain, to David Hartley, in the following words, viz.;
[Here follows the Commission.]</p>

<p>And now the said David Hartley, Minister Plenipotentiary
of his said Britannic Majesty, in behalf of his said
Majesty on the one part, and John Adams, Benjamin
Franklin, and John Jay, Ministers Plenipotentiary of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
said United States of America, in behalf of the said States
on the other, having communicated to each other their
aforesaid full powers in good form, and mutually exchanged
authenticated copies of the same, have, by virtue
thereof agreed, and do hereby agree and conclude upon
the Articles, the tenor of which is as follows, viz.</p>

<p>Whereas reciprocal advantages and mutual convenience
are found, by experience, to form the only permanent
foundation of peace and friendship between States, it is
agreed to form the Articles of this treaty on such principles
of liberal equity and reciprocity, as that partial advantages,
those seeds of discord, being excluded, such a beneficial
and satisfactory intercourse between the two countries
may be established, as to promise and secure to both
perpetual peace and harmony.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p>The same as Article 1st of the preliminary treaty, but
finishing at "every part thereof."</p>

<h3>ARTICLE II.</h3>

<p>The same as Article 2d of the preliminary treaty, but
commencing with the remaining part of Article 1st, "and
that all disputes," &amp;c. and ending with the words, "and
the Atlantic ocean."</p>

<h3>ARTICLE III.</h3>

<p>The same as Article 3d of the preliminary treaty.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE IV.</h3>

<p>It is agreed, that creditors on either side, shall meet
with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value
in sterling money of all <i>bona fide</i> debts heretofore contracted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
excepting that the respective governments on both
sides may, if they think proper, pass acts directing, that, in
consideration of the distresses and disabilities brought on
by the war, and by the interruption of commerce, no execution
shall be issued on a judgment to be obtained in any
such case, until after the expiration of three years from the
date of this definitive treaty; nor shall such judgments include
any allowance for interest for the time that passed
during the war, and until the signing hereof.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE V.</h3>

<p>And whereas doubts have arisen concerning the true
construction of the 5th Article of the provisional treaty,
and great difficulties are likely to arise in its execution, it
is hereby agreed, that the same shall be declared void,
and omitted in this definitive treaty.</p>

<p>And, instead thereof, it is agreed, that as exact an
account as may be, shall be taken by Commissioners to be
appointed for that purpose on each part, of all seizures,
confiscations, or destruction of property belonging to the
adherents of the Crown of Great Britain in America, (exclusive
of prizes made at sea, and debts mentioned in the
preceding Article,) and an account of all seizures, confiscations,
or destruction of property belonging to the adherents
of the United States residing either therein, or in
Canada; and the said property being duly appraized and
valued, the accounts thereof shall be compared, and the
balance shall be paid in money by the party, which has
suffered least, within one year after such adjustment of the
said accounts. And it is further agreed, that all persons,
who have any interest in confiscated lands, either by debts,
or marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no
lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VI.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>The same as Article 6th of the preliminary treaty.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VII.</h3>

<p>There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his
Britannic Majesty and the said States, and between the
subjects of the one, and the citizens of the other. And his
Britannic Majesty shall; with all convenient speed, and
without causing any destruction, or carrying away any
negroes, or other property of the American inhabitants,
withdraw all his armies, garrisons, and fleets from the said
United States, and from every port, place, and harbor
within the same, leaving in all fortifications the American
artillery that may be therein. And shall also order and
cause all archives, records, deeds, and papers belonging to
any of the said States, or their citizens, which, in the
course of the war, may have fallen into the hands of his
officers, to be forthwith restored and delivered to the
proper States and persons to whom they belong. And all
destruction of property, or carrying away of negroes, or
other property belonging to the American inhabitants, contrary
to the above stipulation, shall be duly estimated and
compensated to the owners.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VIII.</h3>

<p>The navigation of the rivers Mississippi and St
Lawrence from their sources to the ocean, shall forever
remain free and open to the subjects of Great
Britain and the citizens of the United States.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE IX.</h3>

<p>The prisoners made respectively by the arms of his
Britannic Majesty and the United States, by land and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
by sea, not already set at liberty, shall be restored
reciprocally and <i>bona fide</i>, immediately after the ratification
of the definitive treaty, without ransom, and on
paying the debts they may have contracted during
their captivity; and each party shall respectively reimburse
the sums which shall have been advanced for
the subsistence and maintenance of their prisoners by
the sovereign of the country where they shall have
been detained, according to the receipts and attested
accounts and other authentic titles, which shall be
produced on each side to commissioners, who shall be
mutually appointed for the purpose of settling the
same.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE X.</h3>

<p>His Britannic Majesty shall employ his good offices
and interposition with the King or Emperor of Morocco
or Fez, the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and
Tripoli, or with any of them, and also with every
other Prince, State, or Power of the coast of Barbary
in Africa, and the subjects of the said King, Emperor,
States, and Powers, and each of them, in order to
provide, as fully and efficaciously as possible, for the
benefit, conveniency and safety of the said United
States, and each of them, their subjects, people, and
inhabitants, and their vessels and effects, against all
violence, insult, attacks, or depredations, on the part
of the said Provinces and States of Barbary, or their
subjects.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XI.</h3>

<p>If war should hereafter arise between Great Britain
and the United States, which God forbid, the merchants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of either country, then residing in the other,
shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their
debts and settle their affairs, and may depart freely,
carrying off all their effects, without molestation or
hinderance. And all fishermen, all cultivators of the
earth, and all artisans or manufacturers, unarmed and
inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, or places, who
labor for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind,
and peaceably follow their respective employments,
shall be allowed to continue the same, and shall
not be molested by the armed force of the enemy, in
whose power, by the events of war, they may happen
to fall; but if anything is necessary to be taken from
them for the use of such armed force, the same shall
be paid for at a reasonable price. All merchants or
traders, with their unarmed vessels employed in commerce,
exchanging the products of different places, and
thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences and
comforts of human life more easy to obtain, and more
general, shall be allowed to pass freely unmolested.
And neither of the powers, parties to this treaty, shall
grant or issue any commission to any private armed
vessel, empowering them to take or destroy such
trading ships or interrupt such commerce.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XII.</h3>

<p>And in case either of the contracting parties shall
happen to be engaged in war with any other nation,
it is further agreed, in order to prevent all the difficulties
and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting
the merchandise heretofore called contraband, such
as arms, ammunition, and military stores of all kinds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
that no such articles carrying by the ships or subjects
of one of the parties to the enemies of the other, shall,
on any account, be deemed contraband, so as to induce
confiscation and a loss of property to individuals;
nevertheless, it shall be lawful to stop such ships and
detain them for such length of time as the captors may
think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage
that might ensue from their proceeding on their
voyage, paying, however, a reasonable compensation
for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors.
And it shall further be allowed to use in the
service of the captors, the whole, or any part of the
military stores so detained, paying to the owners the
full value of the same, to be ascertained by the current
price at the place of its destination.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XIII.</h3>

<p>The citizens and inhabitants of the said United
States, or any of them, may take and hold real estates
in Great Britain, Ireland, or any other of his Majesty's
dominions, and dispose by testament, donation, or
otherwise, of their property, real or personal, in favor
of such persons as to them shall seem fit; and their
heirs, citizens of the United States, or any of them,
residing in the British dominions, or elsewhere, may
succeed them, <i>ab intestato</i>, without being obliged to
obtain letters of naturalization.</p>

<p>The subjects of his Britannic Majesty shall enjoy
on their part, in all the dominions of the said United
States, an entire and perfect reciprocity, relative to the
stipulations contained in the present Article.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<h3>ARTICLE XIV.</h3>

<p>His Majesty consents, that the citizens of the United
States may cut logwood as heretofore in the district
allotted to his subjects by the treaty with Spain, on
condition that they bring or send the said logwood to
Great Britain, or Ireland, and to no other part of
Europe.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XV.</h3>

<p>All the lakes, rivers, and waters, divided by the
boundary line, or lines, between his Britannic Majesty's
territories and those of the United States, as well
as the rivers mentioned in Article &mdash;&mdash; shall be
freely used and navigated by the subjects and citizens
of his said Majesty and of the said States, in common
over the whole extent or breadth of the said lakes,
rivers and waters. And all the carrying places, on
which side soever situated of the said dividing waters,
or between the said rivers and the waters or territories
of either of the parties, may and shall be freely used
by the traders of both, without any restraint, demand
of duties, or tax, or any imposition whatsoever, except
such as inhabitants of the country may be subject
to.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XVI.</h3>

<p>That in all places belonging to the United States, or
either of them, in the country adjoining to the water
line of division, and which, during the war, were in
his Majesty's possession, all persons at present resident
or having possessions or occupations as merchants or
otherwise, may remain in the peaceable enjoyment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
all civil rights, and in pursuit of their occupations,
unless they shall within seven years from the date
hereof, receive notice from Congress or the State to
which any such place may appertain, to remove, and
that upon any such notice of removal a term of two
years shall be allowed for selling or withdrawing their
effects and for settling their affairs.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XVII.</h3>

<p>It is further agreed, that his Britannic Majesty's
forces, not exceeding &mdash;&mdash; in number,
may continue in the posts now occupied by them,
contiguous to the water line, until Congress shall give
them notice to evacuate the said posts, and American
garrisons shall arrive at said posts for the purpose of
securing the lives, property, and peace of any persons
settled in that country, against the invasion or ravages
of the neighboring Indian nations, who may be suspected
of retaining resentments in consequence of the
late war.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XVIII.</h3>

<p>It is further agreed, that his Britannic Majesty shall
cause to be evacuated the ports of New York, Penobscot
and their dependencies, with all other posts and
places in possession of his Majesty's arms within the
United States, in three months after the signing of this
treaty, or sooner if possible, excepting those posts
contiguous to the water line abovementioned, which
are to be evacuated on notice as specified in Article
XVII.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE XIX.</h3>

<p>It is agreed that all vessels, which shall have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
taken by either party from the other, after the term of
twelve days within the Channel or the North Seas, or
after the term of one month anywhere to the northward
of the latitude of the Canaries inclusively, or
after the term of two months between the latitude of
the Canaries and the Equinoctial line, or after the
term of five months in any other part of the world
(all which said terms are to be computed from the third
day of February last,) shall be restored.</p>

<p>His said Britannic Majesty and the said United
States promise to observe sincerely and <i>bona fide</i>, all
the Articles contained and settled in the present
treaty; and they will not suffer the same to be infringed,
directly or indirectly, by their respective subjects
and citizens.</p>

city of London, or Philadelphia, between the contracting
parties in the space of &mdash;&mdash; months, or sooner

I beg leave to inform your Excellencies, that I am ready
to sign the definitive treaty, between Great Britain and
the United States of America, whenever it shall be convenient
to you. I beg the favor, therefore, of you to fix
the day. My instructions confine me to Paris, as the

<p>The American Ministers Plenipotentiary for making
peace with Great Britain, present their compliments to
Mr Hartley. They regret that Mr Hartley's instructions
will not permit him to sign the definitive treaty of peace
with America at the place appointed for the signature of

<p class="letter_head">Paris, September 4th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>It is with the sincerest pleasure that I congratulate
you on the happy event which took place yesterday,
viz.; the signature of the definitive treaty between our
two countries. I considered it as the auspicious presage
of returning confidence, and of the future intercourse
of all good offices between us. I doubt not
that our two countries will entertain the same sentiments,
and that they will behold with satisfaction the
period which terminates the memory of their late unhappy
dissensions, and which leads to the renewal of
all the ancient ties of amity and peace. I can assure
you, that his Britannic Majesty and his confidential
servants entertain the strongest desire of a cordial good
understanding with the United States of America.
And that nothing may be wanting on our parts to perfect
the great work of pacification, I shall propose to
you in a very short time, to renew the discussion of
those points of amity and intercourse which have been
lately suspended, to make way for the signature of the
treaties between all the late belligerent powers, which
took place yesterday.</p>

<p>We have now the fairest prospects before us, and an
unembarrassed field for the exercise of every beneficent
disposition, and for the accomplishment of every
object of reciprocal advantage between us. Let us,
then, join our hearts and hands together in one common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I received in its time the letter you did me the
honor of writing to me by Mr Hartley; and I cannot
let him depart without expressing my satisfaction in
his conduct towards us, and applauding the prudence
of that choice, which sent us a man possessed of such
a spirit of conciliation, and of all that frankness, sincerity,
and candor, which naturally produce confidence,
and thereby facilitate the most difficult negotiations.
Our countries are now happily at peace, on
which I congratulate you most cordially; and I beg
you to be assured, that as long as I have any concern
in public affairs, I shall readily and heartily concur
with you in promoting every measure that may tend

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Passy, September 5th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have received the letter you did us the honor
to write yesterday.</p>

<p>Your friendly congratulations on the signature of
the definitive treaty meet with cordial returns on our
part; and we sincerely rejoice with you on that event,
by which the Ruler of nations has been graciously
pleased to give peace to our two countries.</p>

<p>We are no less ready to join our endeavors than
our wishes with yours, to concert such measures for
regulating the future intercourse between Great Britain
and the United States, as, by being consistent with
the honor and interests of both, may tend to increase
and perpetuate mutual confidence and good will.</p>

<p>We ought, nevertheless, to apprize you, that as no
construction of our commission could at any period
extend it, unless by implication, to several of the proposed
stipulations; and as our instructions respecting
commercial provisions, however explicit, suppose
their being incorporated in the definitive treaty, a recurrence

will be necessary, unless obviated by the despatches
we may sooner receive from them.</p>

<p>We shall immediately write to them on the subject,
and we are persuaded that the same disposition to confidence
and friendship, which has induced them already
to give unrestrained course to British commerce
and unconditionally to liberate all prisoners at a time
when more caution would not have appeared singular,
will also urge their attention to the objects in question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
and lead them to every proper measure for promoting
a liberal and satisfactory intercourse between the two
countries.</p>

<p>We have communicated to Congress the repeated
friendly assurances with which you have officially
honored us on these subjects, and we are persuaded
that the period of their being realized will have an
auspicious and conciliating influence on all the parties
in the late unhappy dissensions.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Passy, September 10th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>On the 3d instant definitive treaties of peace were concluded
between all the late belligerent powers, except the
Dutch, who the day before settled and signed preliminary
articles of peace with Britain.</p>

<p>We most sincerely and cordially congratulate Congress
and our country in general on this happy event; and we
hope, that the same kind providence, which has led us
through a rigorous war to an honorable peace, will enable
us to make a wise and moderate use of that inestimable
blessing.</p>

<p>We have communicated a duplicate original of the
treaty to the care of Mr Thaxter, who will go immediately
to L'Orient, whence he will sail in the French packet to
New York. That gentleman left America with Mr Adams
as his private Secretary, and his conduct having been perfectly
satisfactory to that Minister, we join in recommending
him to the attention of Congress. We have ordered
Mr Grand to pay him one hundred and thirty louis d'ors,
on account of the reasonable expenses to be incurred by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
his mission to Congress, and his journey from thence to his
family at Hingham, in the Massachusetts Bay. For the
disposition of the money he is to account. The definitive
treaty being in the terms of the Provisional Articles,
and not comprehending any of the objects of our subsequent
negotiations, it is proper that we give a summary
account of them.</p>

<p>When Mr Hartley arrived here, he brought with him
only a set of instructions, signed by the King. We objected
to proceeding with him until he should have a commission
in form. This occasioned some delay. A proper
commission was, however, transmitted to him, a copy of
which was shortly after sent to Mr Livingston.</p>

<p>We having been instructed to obtain, if possible, an Article
for a direct trade to the West Indies, made to Mr
Hartley the proposition No. 1.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>He approved of it greatly, and recommended it to his
Court, but they declined assenting to it.</p>

<p>Mr Hartley then made us the proposition No. 2;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but
being asked, whether he was authorised to sign it, in case
we agreed to it, he answered in the negative. We, therefore,
thought it improper to proceed to the consideration of
it, until after he should have obtained the consent of his
Court to it. We also desired to be informed, whether his
Court would, or would not, comprehend Ireland in their
stipulations with us.</p>

<p>The British Cabinet would not adopt Mr Hartley's
propositions, but their letters to him were calculated to inspire
us with expectations, that as nothing but particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
local circumstances, which would probably not be of long
duration, restrained them from preferring the most liberal
system of commerce with us, the Ministry would take the
earliest opportunity of gratifying their own wishes, as well
as ours, on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr Hartley then made us the propositions No. 3.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At
this time, we were informed, that letters for us had arrived
in France from Philadelphia; we expected to receive
instructions in them, and told Mr Hartley, that this expectation
induced us to postpone giving him an answer for a
few days.</p>

<p>The vessel by which we expected these letters, it seems
had not brought any for us. But at that time information
arrived from America, that our ports were all opened to
British vessels. Mr Hartley thereupon did not think himself
at liberty to proceed, until after he should communicate
that intelligence to his Court and receive their further
instructions.</p>

<p>Those further instructions never came; and thus our
endeavors as to commercial regulations proved fruitless.
We had many conferences, and received long Memorials
from Mr Hartley on the subject; but his zeal for systems
friendly to us, constantly exceeded his authority to concert
and agree to them.</p>

<p>During the long interval of his expecting instructions,
for his expectations were permitted to exist almost to the
last, we proceeded to make and receive propositions for
perfecting the definitive treaty. Details of all the amendments,
alterations, objections, expectations, &amp;c. which occurred
in the course of these discussions, would be voluminous.
We finally agreed that he should send to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Court the project or draft of a treaty, No. 4.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He did
so, but after much time, and when pressed by France,
who insisted that we should all conclude together, he was
instructed to sign a definitive treaty in the terms of the
Provisional Articles.</p>

<p>Whether the British Court meant to avoid a definitive
treaty with us, through a vain hope, from the exaggerated
accounts of divisions among our people, and want of authority
in Congress, that some revolution might soon happen
in their favor; or whether their dilatory conduct was
caused by the strife of the two opposite and nearly equal
parties in the Cabinet, is hard to decide.</p>

<p>Your Excellency will observe, that the treaty was signed
at Paris, and not at Versailles. Mr Hartley's letter of
August 29th, and our answer, will explain this. His objections,
and indeed our proceedings in general, were communicated
to the French Minister, who was content that
we should acquiesce, but desired that we would appoint
the signing early in the morning, and give him an account
of it at Versailles by express, for that he would not proceed
to sign on the part of France, till he was sure that
our business was done.</p>

<p>The day after the signature of the treaty, Mr Hartley
wrote us a congratulatory letter, to which we replied.</p>

<p>He has gone to England, and expects soon to return,
which for our parts we think uncertain. We have taken
care to speak to him in strong terms, on the subject of
the evacuation of New York, and the other important
subjects proper to be mentioned to him. We think
we may rely on his doing everything in his power to influence
his Court to do what they ought to do; but it does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
not appear, that they have as yet formed any settled system
for their conduct relative to the United States. We
cannot but think, that the late and present aspect of affairs
in America, has had and continues to have, an unfavorable
influence, not only in Britain but throughout Europe.</p>

<p>In whatever light the Article respecting the tories may
be viewed in America, it is considered in Europe as very
humiliating to Britain, and therefore as being one, which
we ought in honor to perform and fulfil with the most scrupulous
regard to good faith, and in a manner least offensive
to the feelings of the King and Court of Great Britain,
who upon that point are extremely tender.</p>

<p>The unseasonable and unnecessary resolves of various
towns on this subject, the actual expulsion of tories
from some places, and the avowed implacability of almost
all who have published their sentiments about the matter,
are circumstances, which are construed, not only to the
prejudice of our national magnanimity and good faith, but
also to the prejudice of our governments.</p>

<p>Popular committees are considered here, as with us, in
the light of substitutes to constitutional government, and as
being only necessary in the interval between the removal
of the former and the establishment of the present.</p>

<p>The constitutions of the different States have been translated
and published, and pains have been taken to lead
Europe to believe, that the American States, not only
made their own laws, but obeyed them. But the continuance
of popular assemblies, convened expressly to deliberate
on matters proper only for the cognizance of the different
legislatures and officers of government, and their
proceeding not only to ordain, but to enforce their resolutions,
has exceedingly lessened the dignity of the States in
the eyes of these nations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>To this we may also add, that the situation of the army,
the reluctance of the people to pay taxes, and the circumstances
under which Congress removed from Philadelphia,
have diminished the admiration, in which the people of
America were held among the nations of Europe, and
somewhat abated their ardor for forming connexions with
us, before our affairs acquire a greater degree of order
and consistence.</p>

<p>Permit us to observe, that in our opinion, the recommendation
of Congress, promised in the fifth Article, should
immediately be made in the terms of it, and published,
and that the States should be requested to take it into consideration,
as soon as the evacuation by the enemy shall
be completed. It is also much to be wished, that the
legislatures may not involve all the tories in banishment
and ruin, but that such discrimination may be made, as to
entitle the decisions to the approbation of disinterested men
and dispassionate posterity.</p>

<p>On the 7th instant we received your Excellency's letter
of the 16th of June last, covering a resolution of Congress
of the 1st of May, directing a commission to us for making
a treaty of commerce, &amp;c. with Great Britain. This intelligence
arrived very opportunely to prevent the anti-American
party in England from ascribing any delays, on
our part, to motives of resentment to that country. Great
Britain will send a Minister to Congress, as soon as Congress
shall send a Minister to Britain, and we think much
good might result from that measure.</p>

<p>The information of M. Dumas, that we encouraged the
idea of entering into engagements with the Dutch, to defend
the freedom of trade, was not well founded. Our
sentiments on that subject exactly correspond with those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Congress; nor did we even think or pretend, that we had
authority to adopt any such measures.</p>

<p>We have reason to think that the Emperor, and Russia,
and other commercial nations, are ready to make treaties of
commerce with the United States. Perhaps it might not
be improper for Congress to direct, that their disposition
on the subject be communicated to those Courts, and
thereby prepare the way for such treaties.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Morocco has manifested a very friendly
disposition towards us. He expects, and is ready to receive
a Minister from us; and as he may either change
his mind, or may be succeeded by a prince differently disposed,
a treaty with him may be of importance. Our trade
to the Mediterranean will not be inconsiderable, and the
friendship of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli may become
very interesting, in case the Russians should succeed
in their endeavors to navigate freely into it by Constantinople.</p>

<p>Much, we think, will depend on the success of our negotiations
with England. If she should be prevailed upon
to agree to a liberal system of commerce, France, and
perhaps some other nations, will follow her example; but
if she should prefer an exclusive, monopolizing plan, it is
probable that her neighbors will continue to adhere to their
favorite restrictions.</p>

<p>Were it certain that the United States could be brought
to act as a nation, and would jointly and fairly conduct
their commerce on principles of exact reciprocity with all
nations, we think it probable that Britain would make extensive
concessions. But, on the contrary, while the prospect
of disunion in our councils, or want of power and energy
in our executive departments exist, they will not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
apprehensive of retaliation, and consequently lose their
principal motive to liberty. Unless, with respect to all
foreign nations and transactions, we uniformly act as an
entire united nation, faithfully executing and obeying the
constitutional acts of Congress on those subjects, we shall
soon find ourselves in the situation in which all Europe
wishes to see us, viz. as unimportant consumers of
her manufactures and productions, and as useful laborers
to furnish her with raw materials.</p>

<p>We beg leave to assure Congress that we shall apply
our best endeavors to execute this new commission to their
satisfaction, and shall punctually obey such instructions as
they may be pleased to give us relative to it. Unless Congress
have nominated a Secretary to that commission, we
shall consider ourselves at liberty to appoint one; and as
we are satisfied with the conduct of Mr Franklin, the Secretary
to our late commission, we propose to appoint him,
leaving it to Congress to make such compensation for his
services as they may judge proper.</p>

<p>Count de Vergennes communicated to us a proposition,
viz. herewith enclosed,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> for explaining the 2d and 3d Articles
of our treaty with France in a manner different from
the sense in which we understand them. This being a
matter in which we have no right to interfere, we have not
expressed any opinion about it to the Court.</p>

<p>
With great respect, we have the honor to be, Sir, your
Excellency's most obedient and most humble servants,</p>

B. FRANKLIN,<br />

<h3>FROM CONGRESS TO THE COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">October 29th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">By the United States in Congress assembled.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
To the Commissioners of the United States of America
at the Court of Versailles, empowered to negotiate
a peace, or to any one or more of them;
</p></div>

<p>1st. You are instructed and authorised to announce to
his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Germany, or to his
Ministers, the high sense which the United States in Congress
assembled entertain of his exalted character and eminent
virtues, and their earnest desire to cultivate his friendship,
and to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce for
the mutual advantage of the subjects of his Imperial Majesty,
and the citizens of these United States.</p>

<p>2dly. You are instructed to meet the advances and
encourage the disposition of the other commercial powers
in Europe for entering into treaties of amity and commerce
with these United States. In negotiations on this subject,
you will lay it down as a principle in no case to be deviated
from, that they shall respectively have for their basis
the mutual advantage of the contracting parties on terms of
the most perfect equality and reciprocity, and not to be
repugnant to any of the treaties already entered into by the
United States with France and other foreign powers.
That such treaties shall, in the first instance, be proposed
for a term not exceeding fifteen years, and shall not be
finally conclusive until they shall respectively have been
transmitted to the United States in Congress assembled,
for their examination and final direction; and that, with the
drafts or propositions for such treaties, shall be transmitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
all the information which shall come within the knowledge
of the said Ministers respecting the same; and their observations
after the most mature inquiry on the probable advantages
or disadvantages and effects of such treaties
respectively.</p>

<p>3dly. You are instructed to continue to press upon the
Ministers of his Danish Majesty the justice of causing satisfaction
to be made for the value of the ships and goods
captured by the Alliance frigate and sent into Bergen, and
how essentially it concerns the honor of the United States
that their gallant citizens should not be deprived of any
part of those prizes, which they had so justly acquired by
their valor. That as far as Congress have been informed,
the estimate of those prizes at fifty thousand pounds
sterling is not immoderate; that no more however is desired
than their true value, after every deduction which
shall be thought equitable. That Congress have a sincere
disposition to cultivate the friendship of his Danish Majesty,
and to promote a commercial intercourse between his subjects
and the citizens of the United States, on terms which
shall promise mutual advantage to both nations. That it
is therefore the wish of Congress, that this claim should
still be referred to the equitable disposition of his Danish
Majesty, in full confidence that the reasonable expectations
of the parties interested will be fully answered; accordingly
you are fully authorised and directed, after
exerting your best endeavors to enforce the said claim to
the extent it shall appear to you to be well founded, to
make abatements if necessary, and ultimately to accept
such compensation as his Danish Majesty can be prevailed
upon to grant.</p>

<p>4thly. You are further instructed, to inquire and report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
to Congress the reasons why the expedition of the
Alliance and Bon Homme Richard, and the squadron
which accompanied them, was carried on at the expense
and on account of the Court of France; whether any part
of the profit arising therefrom accrued to the United
States; or any of the expense thereof has been placed
to their account; whether the proceeds of any of the
prizes taken in that expedition, and which is due to the
American officers and seamen employed therein, is deposited
in Europe; and what amount, where, and in whose
hands.</p>

<p>5thly. The acquisition of support to the independence
of the United States having been the primary object of the
instructions to our Ministers respecting the convention of
the neutral maritime powers for maintaining the freedom of
commerce, you will observe, that the necessity of such
support is superseded by the treaties lately entered into for
restoring peace. And although Congress approve of the
principles of that convention, as it was founded on the
liberal basis of the maintenance of the rights of neutral
nations, and of the privileges of commerce, yet they are
unwilling at this juncture, to become a party to a confederacy
which may hereafter too far complicate the interests
of the United States with the politics of Europe; and,
therefore, if such a progress is not already made in this
business as may render it dishonorable to recede, it is the
desire of Congress and their instruction to each of the
Ministers of the United States at the respective Courts in
Europe, that no further measures be taken at present
towards the admission of the United States into that confederacy.</p>

<p>6thly. The Ministers of these States for negotiating a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
peace with Great Britain are hereby instructed, authorised
and directed, to urge forward the definitive treaty to a
speedy conclusion; and unless there shall be an immediate
prospect of obtaining articles or explanations beneficial to
the United States, in addition to the Provisional Articles,
that they shall agree to adopt the Provisional Articles as
the substance of a definitive treaty of peace.</p>

<p>7thly. The Minister or Ministers of these United
States for negotiating a peace are hereby instructed to negotiate
an explanation of the following paragraph of the
declaration acceded to by them on the 20th of January,
1783, relative to captures, viz. "that the term should be
one month from the Channel and North Sea as far as the
Canary Islands, inclusively, whether in the ocean or the
Mediterranean."</p>

<p>8thly. Mr Jay is hereby authorised to direct Mr Carmichael
to repair to Paris, should Mr Jay be of opinion
that the interest of the United States at the Court of
Madrid may not be injured by Mr Carmichael's absence;
and that Mr Carmichael carry with him the books and
vouchers necessary to make a final and complete settlement
of the accounts of public moneys which have passed
through the hands of Mr Jay and himself; and that Mr
Barclay attend Mr Jay and Mr Carmichael to adjust those
accounts.</p>

<p>9thly. Mr Jay has leave to go to Bath, should he find
it necessary for the benefit of his health.</p>

<div class="section_break"></div>

<p>Conrad Alexander Gerard was the first Minister
from any foreign Court to the United States.
When the American Commissioners went to Paris, in
the year 1776, he was principal Secretary to the
Council of State, and on terms of the strictest intimacy
and confidence with Count de Vergennes, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Under the auspices of that Minister,
and in concert with him, M. Gerard early took
a strong interest in the concerns of the United States,
and abetted the cause of their independence. He negotiated,
on the part of the French government, the
first treaties of alliance and commerce with the United
States, signed on the 6th of February, 1778, by him
for one of the contracting parties, and by Franklin,
Deane, and Lee for the other.</p>

<p>His knowledge of American affairs, and his general
ability, pointed him out as the most suitable person to
represent the French Court as Minister to Congress.
He came over to this country in the fleet with Count
d'Estaing and arrived in Philadelphia about the middle
of July, 1778. After discharging the duties of a
Minister Plenipotentiary for more than a year, in a
manner highly acceptable to Congress and the whole
country, as well as to his own government, he asked
his recall, and took his final leave of Congress on the
17th of September, 1779. He returned to Europe in
the same vessel, which took out Mr Jay as Minister
Plenipotentiary to the Court of Spain.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Very dear and great Friends and Allies,</p>

<p>The treaties which we have signed with you in
consequence of the propositions made to us on your
part, by your deputies, are a certain guarantee to you
of our affection for the United States in general, and
for each one of them individually, as well as of the

take, in their happiness and prosperity. In order to
convince you of this in a more particular manner, we
have appointed M. Gerard, Secretary of our Council
of State, to reside near you in quality of our Minister
Plenipotentiary. He is the better acquainted with the
sentiments which we entertain towards you, and is the
more able to answer for them to you, as he has been
intrusted on our part with negotiating with your
deputies, and as he has signed with them the treaties
which cement our union, we request you to give full
credit to all that he shall say to you on our part, particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>

<h3>APPOINTMENT OF CONSUL-GENERAL OF FRANCE IN
THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>Louis, by the Grace of God, King of France and
Navarre, to all those to whom these presents shall
come, Greeting.</p>

<p>Thinking it necessary to create the office of our
Consul-General at Boston, and other ports belonging
to the United States of North America, and being desirous
to confer a favor on M. Gerard, we have
thought that we could not make choice of a better person
than he, to fulfil the duties of this office, by our
knowledge of his zeal and affection for our service and
for the interests of our subjects, and of his judgment
and ability in naval affairs; for these reasons, and
others moving us thereto, we have nominated and appointed
the said M. Gerard, and by these presents
signed with our hand, do nominate and appoint him
our Consul-General at Boston, and other ports belonging
to the United States of North America, with
power to appoint consuls and vice-consuls in the
places where he shall judge them necessary; to have
and to hold the said office, to exercise, enjoy, and use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
it, so long as it shall please us, with the honors, authorities,
advantages, prerogatives, privileges, exemptions,
rights, benefits, profits, revenues, and emoluments
which belong to it, such, and the same as those which
our other Consuls-General enjoy. We prohibit all
French merchants, and all persons sailing under the
French flag, from disturbing him in the possession,
duties and exercise of this consulate. We enjoin on all
captains, masters and commanders of ships, barks and
other vessels, armed and sailing under the said flag, as
well as on all our other subjects, to acknowledge the
said M. Gerard, and to obey him in this capacity.
We pray and request our very dear and great Friends
and Allies, the Congress of the United States of North
America, their governors and other officers whom it
shall concern, to allow the said M. Gerard, and the
consuls and vice-consuls whom he shall appoint to the
said office, to possess it fully and peaceably, without
causing, or allowing to be caused to them, any disturbance
or hinderance; but on the contrary to give
them all favor and assistance; offering to do the same
for all those who shall be thus recommended to us on
their part. In witness whereof we have caused our
privy seal to be affixed to these presents.</p>

<h3>THE KING OF FRANCE TO CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_open">Very dear and great Friends and Allies,</p>

<p>You will learn, undoubtedly, with gratitude, the measure,
which the conduct of the King of Great Britain
has induced us to take, of sending a fleet to endeavor to
destroy the English forces upon the shores of North
America. This expedition will convince you of the eagerness
and the vigor, which we are resolved to bring to the
execution of the engagements, which we have contracted
with you. We are firmly persuaded, that your fidelity to
the obligations, which your Plenipotentiaries have contracted
in your name, will animate more and more the efforts,
which you are making with so much courage and perseverance.</p>

<p>The Count d'Estaing, Vice-Admiral of France, is
charged to concert with you the operations, the conduct of
which we have intrusted to him, in order that the combination
of measures on each side may render them as advantageous
to the common cause as circumstances will
permit. We entreat you to give full credit to everything,
which he shall communicate to you on our part, and to
place confidence in his zeal and in his talents.</p>

<p>Moreover, we pray God, that he will have you, very
dear and great Friends and Allies, under his holy protection.</p>

<h3>COUNT D'ESTAING TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">At Sea, July 8th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor of informing your Excellency, and by
you of giving notice to Congress, of the arrival of the
squadron of the King upon the shores of the United States
of America.</p>

<p>Honored with full powers from the King to treat with
Congress, I have the honor, Sir, of sending to your Excellency
the copy of my credentials relating to this subject,
the honor of presenting them myself; my desire to
wait upon the respectable representatives of a free nation,
my eagerness to reverence in them the noble qualities of
wisdom and firmness, which distinguish them, virtues
which all Europe admires and which France loves, are a
happiness, which can be delayed only by my desire to
render myself worthy of the favors of the United States,
while I begin by performing the duties, which circumstances
and my military functions impose upon me; I hope
that they will serve as my excuse, and that your Excellency
will have the kindness to offer them as such to Congress.</p>

<p>I have the honor of writing to his Excellency, General
Washington, and shall have that of sending to his head
quarters two officers in succession, in order to offer to him
to combine my movements with his own. The merited
reputation, which so great a soldier has so justly acquired,
does not allow me to doubt that he is convinced better
than any one else of the value of the first movements. I
hope that the authority vested in him by Congress, has allowed
him the liberty of taking advantage of them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
that we shall be able immediately, and without any delay,
to act in concert for the benefit of the common cause;
which seemed to me to require, that the orders of Congress
should remove as speedily as possible, the legal difficulties,
of which, perhaps, there are none.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Chouin, Major of infantry, and relation of
M. de Sartine, is charged with delivering this letter to your
Excellency; he is one of the officers whom I send to
General Washington.</p>

<p>The readiness with which his Excellency, M. Gerard,
Minister Plenipotentiary of the King, is hastening to
take up his residence near Congress, and there to display
the character with which his Majesty has invested
him, will prevent all the delays, which my distance might
occasion with regard to the military agreements. I have
the honor of assuring your Excellency, that I shall make it
my duty and pleasure to execute everything that M.
Gerard shall promise. The promises, which he will make
to you, will need no other ratifications on my part than
those, which my physical force demands, and which the
nature of the profession makes necessarily to depend upon
the military or naval force, which is in operation.</p>

<p>A Minister so happy as to have had the glory of signing
the treaty, which unites two powers whose interests are so
intimately connected, will preserve the most important influence
upon my further designs. The escort, which
conducts him, that by which the King sends back to the
United States his Excellency, Silas Deane, is, undoubtedly,
the most brilliant which has ever accompanied Ambassadors.
I dare hope that it will prove useful to the
mutual interest of the two nations.</p>

<p>That will be the happiest moment of my life, in which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
shall be able to contribute to it in anything. I shall, at the
same time fulfil my duty, as an officer charged with the
orders of his Majesty, and I shall satisfy my principles and
my inclination as an individual.</p>

<p class="indent1">
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signed">ESTAING.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> Permit me to recommend to the favor of Congress,
Messrs John Nicholson, Elias Johnson, and Henry
Johnson. Mr Nicholson preserved the ship Tonnant,
which is the second in the squadron, and Mr Elias Johnson
conducted himself with the greatest zeal and the
greatest bravery on board the frigate Engageante, in the
engagement in which she took the privateer Rose, in the
Chesapeake Bay.</p>

In Congress, July 11th, 1778.</p>

<p>Resolved, that General Washington be informed by the
President, that it is the desire of Congress, that he co-operate
with the Count d'Estaing, commander of a French
squadron now on the coast of North America, and proceeding
to New York, in the execution of such offensive
operations against the enemy as they shall mutually approve.</p>

<p>His Most Christian Majesty, the King of France, having
thought proper to send on the coasts a powerful fleet,
in order to co-operate with the forces of these States in
the reduction of the British army and navy, Resolved,
that General Washington be impowered to call on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, or such of
them as he shall judge proper, for such aids of their militia
as he shall think requisite for carrying on his operations, in
concert with Count d'Estaing, commander of the French
fleet; and that it be earnestly recommended to the abovementioned,
to exert themselves in forwarding the force,
which may be required of them with the utmost despatch.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Marine Committee be directed to
order the Commissioners of the navy to the eastward, to
fit out as many continental frigates and armed vessels as
possible, with the utmost despatch, to join the French
squadron in their operations against the enemy.</p>

<p>Ordered, that the Board of War take measures for providing
a suitable house for the accommodation of M. Gerard;
and that they give the necessary orders for receiving
M. Gerard with proper honor on his arrival.</p>

<p>Resolved, that a committee of five be appointed to wait
on M. Gerard on his arrival, and conduct him to his
lodgings.</p>

<p>The members chosen, Mr Hancock, Mr Lee, Mr Drayton,
Mr Roberdeau, and Mr Duer.</p>

<p>Next morning the committee went to Chester to meet
M. Gerard, who received them on board the frigate. In
going on board they were saluted with fifteen guns. They
then went on shore and waited on him to Philadelphia,
and conducted him to General Arnold's head quarters,
where a dinner was provided for him and his suit, and a
number of the members of Congress. Before dinner he
waited on the President.</p>

<p>On Tuesday he delivered to the President sundry papers
to be laid before Congress,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> desiring to know in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
capacity Congress were willing to receive him; whether
as Minister Plenipotentiary or resident, intimating, that in
whatever quality he was received, it would be expected,
that the Commissioners from the States at the Court of
France should be vested with the same.</p>

answer standing. The Minister shall stand while the
President delivers the answer.</p>

<p>Having spoken, and being answered, the Minister and
the President shall bow to each other, at which time the
House shall bow, and then the Minister shall be conducted
home in the manner in which he was brought to the
House.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the door of the Congress chamber be
open during the audience to be given to the Minister Plenipotentiary
of his Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<p>That the delegates of Pennsylvania be requested to inform
the Vice President, the Supreme Executive Council,
and the Speaker and Assembly of the said State, that the

in writing to the President, and is as follows;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_open">
"Gentlemen,</p>

<p>"The connexions which the King, my master, has
formed with the United States of America, are so
agreeable to him, that he has been unwilling to delay
sending me to reside near you to unite them more
closely. His Majesty will be gratified to learn, that
the sentiments which are manifested on this occasion
justify the confidence, with which the zeal and the
character of the deputies of the United States in
France, the wisdom and the firmness which have directed
your resolutions, together with the courage and
the constancy which the people have displayed, have
inspired him. You know, Gentlemen, that this confidence
has laid the foundation of the truly friendly and
disinterested plan, upon which his Majesty has treated
with the United States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"It has not rested with him, that his engagements
could not secure your independence and your tranquillity
without the further effusion of blood, and without
aggravating the miseries of mankind, of which it is his
whole ambition to secure the happiness; but the hostile
dispositions and resolutions of the common enemy
having given a present force, positive, permanent, and
indissoluble, to engagements wholly eventual, the
King, my master, has thought that the two allies should
occupy themselves only with the means of fulfilling
them in the manner the most useful to the common
cause, and of the most effect in obtaining peace, which
is the object of the alliance. It is in conformity with
this principle, that his Majesty has hastened to send
you a powerful assistance. You owe it, Gentlemen,
to his friendship, to the sincere interest which he takes
in the welfare of the United States, and to the desire
which he has of concurring effectually in securing your
peace and your prosperity on honorable and firm foundations.
He hopes, moreover, that the principles
adopted by the governments will contribute to extend
the connexions, which the mutual interest of the respective
nations had already begun to form between
them. The principal point of my instructions is to
make the interests of France and those of the United
States keep pace together. I flatter myself, that my
past conduct in affairs which interest them, has already
convinced you that I have no more earnest
desire, than that of executing my instructions in such a
manner as to deserve the confidence of Congress, the
friendship of its members, and the esteem of all the
citizens."

<p>To this speech the President returned the following
answer;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_open">
"Sir,</p>

<p>"The treaties between his Most Christian Majesty
and the United States of America so fully demonstrate
his wisdom and magnanimity as to command the
reverence of all nations. The virtuous citizens of
America in particular can never forget his beneficent
attention to their violated rights, nor cease to acknowledge
the hand of a gracious Providence in raising for
them so powerful and illustrious a friend. It is the
hope and the opinion of Congress, that the confidence
his Majesty reposes in the firmness of these States
will receive additional strength from every day's experience.</p>

<p>"This assembly are convinced, Sir, that had it
rested solely with the Most Christian King, not only
the independence of these States would have been
universally acknowledged, but their tranquillity fully
established; we lament that lust of domination, which
gave birth to the present war and has prolonged and
extended the miseries of mankind. We ardently wish
to sheathe the sword, and spare the further effusion of
blood; but we are determined, by every means in our
power, to fulfil those eventual engagements, which
have acquired positive and permanent force from the
hostile designs and measures of the common enemy.</p>

<p>"Congress have reason to believe, that the assistance
so wisely and generously sent will bring Great Britain
to a sense of justice and moderation, promote the interests
of France and America, and secure peace and
tranquillity on the most firm and honorable foundation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Neither can it be doubted, that those who administer
the powers of government, within the several States of
this Union, will cement that connexion with the subjects
of France, the beneficent effects of which have
already been so sensibly felt.</p>

<p>"Sir, from the experience we have had of your exertions
to promote the true interests of our country as
well as your own, it is with the highest satisfaction
Congress receive as the first Minister from his Most
Christian Majesty, a gentleman, whose past conduct
affords a happy presage that he will merit the confidence
of this body, the friendship of its members, and
the esteem of the citizens of America."</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor

America, that he has obtained, on account of his Majesty,
the cargo of two schooners; the one called the Gentil,
George André, Captain, and the other the Adventurer,

The destination of these provisions, requiring that they
should depart immediately, the undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary
requests Congress to be pleased to take the

<p>The Minister of France thinks it his duty to have the
honor of communicating to the President of Congress the
reflection that, according to ordinary rules, treaties are not
published until the respective ratifications have been exchanged,
and that so far as he is informed, that of the King

<p>The President communicated to Congress the following
unsigned note from the Minister of France.</p>

<p>"It is thought proper to inform persons, who have business
in France, that all judicial and extra-judicial acts,
powers of attorney, &amp;c. which are destined to be sent

in the different States of America. By means
of this formality, all the acts valid in America will have
the same validity in France in all cases."</p>

<p><i>December 4th.</i> The President communicated to Congress
another unsigned note from the Minister of France,
relative to a plan he had proposed for discharging the debt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
due to Roderique Hortalez &amp; Co. namely, by furnishing
the French fleet in America with provisions, for the amount
of which the Court would procure the United States a
credit with Hortalez &amp; Co. The note was delivered in
English, in the words following.</p>

<p>"Leave is begged from the Honorable the President of
Congress to submit to him some reflections upon a late conversation.
The insinuation made was founded upon the
consideration, that the method proposed would be more
simple, more easy, and more convenient, than any other,
and that besides, the troubles, the expenses, the dangers
of the sea, and of the enemy, the spoiling of the cargoes,
&amp;c. would be avoided.</p>

<p>"The manner of executing this plan, if adopted, would
be very simple, and attended with no inconveniency; the
Court shall take upon itself to satisfy the furnisher of the
articles in question, and Congress shall receive the discharge
for ready money, in their accounts with the Court."</p>

this subject has not escaped the consideration of Congress,
but believing that it is for the interest of the King, his master,
that his Majesty should contribute to the measures
which may effect this object, his intention is to offer a reward
to the owners of privateers, who shall take or destroy
vessels loaded with masts proper for ships of the line or
for frigates. This encouragement seemed necessary, in
order to turn the efforts of privateers in this direction, considering
the low price of this commodity in proportion to
other cargoes, but the said Minister did not wish to execute
this plan without communicating it to Congress, and

<p>I have had the honor to make known to you the
reasons of my perplexity, with regard to transmitting
to my Court some ideas respecting certain persons
strongly suspected of being emissaries of the Court of
London, as well as concerning the doctrine of the liberty,
which it is pretended the United States have
preserved of treating with this power separately from
their ally, so long as Great Britain has not declared
war upon the King my master. I have expressed to
you how far it is from my character to pay regard to
public rumors and to the reports of any individuals, in
a matter as important as it is delicate, and the desire
which I feel that Congress would be pleased to furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
me with the means of placing my Court, and by its
means, all the present and future friends of the United
States in Europe, on their guard against the impressions
which these ideas might produce. They appeared
to me particularly dangerous in relation to
England, where they would nourish the hope of sowing
domestic divisions in the bosom of the United
States, and of separating them from their ally, by
annulling, also, the treaties concluded with him. It
seems, in fact, that as long as this double hope shall
continue, England will not think seriously of acknowledging
your independence on the footing expressed in
the treaty of Paris. Your zeal, Sir, for your country,
and for the maintenance of the harmony so happily
established, is too well known for me not to hope that
you will be pleased to lay before Congress this subject,
which my solicitude for whatever concerns the
maintenance of the reputation of the alliance has caused
me to regard as very important.</p>

<p>I am persuaded, Sir, that you will at the same time
have the goodness to inform Congress of the proof of
firmness, and of attachment to the interests of the
United States, to the common cause and to the alliance,
which the King my master has given, in rejecting
the overtures which the Court of London has made

barrels of flour to complete the quantity of provisions

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France learns by
M. Francy, that, from the offer which he made in
relation to the payment by compensation of a part of
the sums due from the United States to M. de Beaumarchais,
consequences have been drawn, which are
contrary to the intentions of the undersigned.</p>

<p>He finds himself obliged to prevent all mistakes by
declaring in writing, as he always has done verbally,
that all the supplies furnished by M. de Beaumarchais
to the States, whether merchandise or cannons and
military goods, were furnished in the way of commerce,
and that the articles which came from the
King's magazines and arsenals were sold to M. de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Beaumarchais by the department of artillery, and that
he has furnished his obligations for the price of these
articles. He is, consequently, a debtor to the war
department, whilst he is a creditor of the United States
by the sale of these same articles, which had become
his property. On the other side the King is a debtor
to the United States.</p>

<p>It is this situation, namely, the difficulty which
Congress finds in paying M. de Beaumarchais by return
of merchandise, and the considerable saving
which would result to Congress, that has determined
the undersigned to offer a mutual compensation, and to
pay the King's debts to the United States to the
amount of the receipts of M. de Beaumarchais, which
Congress will receive in ready money. This is the
simple and natural operation, which the undersigned
has offered, and which ought not at all to change the
situation of M. de Beaumarchais with regard to Congress,
since he is and continues to be a creditor in his
own name, of the United States, and since the undersigned
simply offers to pay to the discharge of Congress
a certain sum, which the undersigned will determine
in concert with M. de Francy, when Congress
shall have passed a resolution on this offer.</p>

<p>The undersigned thinks that he owes these explanations

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France cannot forbear

underscored in the two gazettes annexed, under date
of the 3d and 5th of this month. He has no doubt of the
indignation of Congress at the indiscreet assertions contained

in the hands of the enemies of the common cause, a
weapon the more powerful and dangerous, as the author is

<p>The aforesaid Minister relies entirely on the wisdom of
Congress to take measures suitable to the circumstance.
It has not been owing to him, that the author has not himself

<p>"If Mr Deane, or any other gentleman, will procure an
order from Congress to inspect an account in my office, or
any of Mr Deane's friends in Congress will take the
trouble of coming themselves, I will give him or them my
attendance, and show them in a hand-writing, which Mr
Deane is well acquainted with, that the supplies he so
pompously plumes himself upon (namely, those which
were sent from France in the Amphitrite, Seine, and Mercury)
were promised and engaged, and that <i>as a present</i>,
before he even arrived in France, and that the part which
fell to Mr Deane was only to see it done, and how he has
performed that service, the public are now acquainted
with." The last paragraph in the account, is "upon Mr
Deane's arrival in France, the business went into his
hands, and the aids were at length embarked in the Amphitrite,
Mercury, and Seine." "I have been the more
explicit on this subject, not so much on Mr Deane's account,
as from a principle of public justice. It shows, in
the first instance, that the greatness of the American cause
drew at its first beginning the attention of Europe, and that
the justness of it was such as appeared to merit support;
and in the second instance, <i>that those who are now her allies
prefaced that alliance by an early and generous friendship</i>;
yet, that we might not attribute too much to human or
auxiliary aid, so unfortunate were those supplies, that only
one ship out of the three arrived; the Mercury and the
Seine fell into the enemy's hands."</p>

<p>I cannot forbear to present to Congress the striking observations
occasioned by the delay, which the answer to
my representation of the beginning of the past month meets
with. Already the enemies of the common cause represent
it as a proof of the diversity of the opinions which
prevail in Congress, as if there could exist a contrariety of
sentiments upon a subject so simple, and a matter so clear,
that to call it in question would be at the same time to
call in question the solidity, and even the existence of the

from adopting suspicions, which would be so fatal to the
common cause; but I have had the honor to explain the

a ready, formal, and explicit declaration. They know
that erroneous opinions become more difficult to destroy
when they have had time to take root in men's minds; it
is then wished to remedy the evil, but it is found irremediable.

I wait impatiently for answers, which may quiet my Court

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We have been penetrated with gratitude on seeing in
the resolution of Congress, annexed to your Excellency's
letter, proofs of esteem with which we are honored by our
illustrious General, and which gives occasion to the proposition
which is made to us, of continuing in the service of
the United States through the next campaign. We willingly
consent to it, since your Excellency thinks, that we
shall thereby fulfil the intentions of the Court, and since
you are so kind as to take upon yourself the trouble of
asking from it the necessary permission. Relying also on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the justice of Congress for the favors which we may merit
from longer services, we affix no conditions to the continuance
of our residence in America. But we deem it our
duty to state, that being determined to remain here by our
desire of serving, and of being useful to the United States,
if the means of usefulness should disappear on any account
whatsoever, we shall be desirous of preserving the liberty
of returning into our country. Sensible of the interest
which your Excellency is so kind as to take in this affair,
we beg you to accept our most humble thanks.</p>

We are, respectfully, your Excellency's most obedient humble servants,</p>

Plenipotentiary of France, and Consul-General, was read,
enclosing a commission of Consul in the port of Boston,
and other ports in Massachusetts Bay, to the Sieur
Valnais. The commission was referred to the Marine

Philadelphia, February 9th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>By instructions addressed to the undersigned on the
29th of October last, he is ordered to transmit to Congress
the answer of the King to certain communications made
to his Majesty by the Commissioners of the United States.</p>

<p>1st. These Commissioners having desired his Majesty
to continue the subsidy which he had granted them, he
gave them to understand, that his affairs did not permit
him to make this engagement, since the war which he is
carrying on against England, and the general situation of
Europe, require expenses which absorb all his resources,
yet in consequence of the representations made by the
deputies, of the difficulty which they found in honoring
the bills of exchange which Congress had drawn upon
them, for the interest due upon money which had been
borrowed, his Majesty has been pleased to grant a sum of
seven hundred and fifty thousand livres, as a new proof of
his friendship for the United States.</p>

<p>2dly. The same Commissioners made known to the
King, that Congress had reason to presume, that a part of
the articles furnished to the United States, was a present
on the part of his Majesty. The undersigned is authorised
to declare, that this intention never existed, that it
was an affair entirely commercial, in which the Ministry
had no other part, than that of permitting M. de Beaumarchais
to take from the magazines and arsenals of the
King, on condition of replacing them, the articles with which
commerce could not supply him, that consequently the Ministry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
had no other power in this affair, than that of preventing
Congress from being pressed too soon for payment for the
articles taken from the magazines and arsenals of the King.
As to the contract made with Roderique Hortalez &amp; Co,
the Ministry has declared to the American deputies, who
asked their advice, upon the ratification or rejection of
this contract, that they did not know the house of Roderique
Hortalez &amp; Co. and that they could not answer for
it, nor express an opinion as to its stability and fidelity in
the performance of its engagements.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, February 9th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of France,
has received a formal order from the King, his master, to
make known to Congress, that the King of Spain, in
order to put an end to the tergiversations of England, has
determined upon a decisive and peremptory proceeding.
His Catholic Majesty has, consequently, made to the King
of England a final offer of his mediation; but with the
declaration that it was the last, and that if it was as fruitless
as those which preceded, it would only remain to
him to perform the duties, which his alliance with the King
imposes upon him.</p>

<p>The King of Spain, by taking this proceeding upon himself
in a friendly manner, has shown a disposition most
favorable to the alliance. The King, my master, on his
side, persists in the invariable resolution not to separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
his interests from those of America, and to support the
cause of the United States, as if it were his own personal
cause.</p>

<p>His Majesty thinks, while fulfilling the duties of the alliance
by this confidential communication, that he ought to
invite and urge Congress to furnish immediately with the
necessary powers and instructions the person or persons
whom they shall think proper to authorise to assist in the
deliberations, and in the conclusion and signing of the
treaty. His Majesty trusts that Congress will perceive the
inestimable value of time in a juncture so critical and so
important; and that the injuries caused by any delay
would be irreparable both to the alliance and the allies.
In complying with the invitations of the King, the United
States would regard equally their dignity and their interests.
The place of the negotiation is fixed at Madrid.</p>

<p>His Majesty, while engaging in everything that can
hasten the happy moment in which America can enjoy,
peaceably, internal and external prosperity, which is the
object of the revolution and the limit of his Majesty's
wishes, has instructed the undersigned to suggest to Congress,
that at a time in which they are employed in fixing
their political existence, it seems to belong to their foresight
to consider the sentiments of the States as to the
peace in relation to Spain, and they will perhaps think,
that the means of preventing all future discontents merits
their attention, and ought to be one of the subjects of the
positive and definite instructions, which the States will give
for the conclusion of the peace.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p><i>February 13th.</i> The President was directed to inform
the Minister, that Congress will take the subject of his
memorials of the 9th into immediate consideration, and
that if he wishes to communicate anything farther to them,
Congress will receive the same from him in a private audience.
And it was at the same time resolved, that all
private audiences given to foreign Ministers be held in a
committee of the whole.</p>

<p><i>February 15th.</i> The President acquainted the House,
that pursuant to their order, he had informed the Minister
of France, that Congress will take his memorials of the
9th into immediate consideration, and that if he wishes to
communicate anything farther to them, Congress will receive
the same in a private audience; that the Minister
wished to make further communications to Congress, and
would attend the House at twelve o'clock this day.</p>

<p>The Minister, agreeably to his appointment, was introduced,
and had a free conference with Congress, in which
he represented the present state of affairs in Europe, the
dispositions of the Spanish Court, and the measures it was
about to take in order to restore peace; from thence he
took occasion to press upon Congress the necessity of
having a Minister in Europe properly empowered and instructed.
He further signified, that it was the desire of his
Most Christian Majesty, that the United States would
speedily put themselves in a condition to take that part in
the negotiation for peace apparently about to take place,
which their dignity and interest required; and that they
should lay a solid foundation for obtaining a speedy peace
agreeably to the terms of the treaty, by giving their Plenipotentiary
the most ample instructions and full powers.
This he enforced by sundry arguments, and pressed the
utmost despatch.</p>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, March 17th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the
honor to remind the Congress of the United States of
North America, that in executing for five months the
instructions with which he has been charged by the
King, his master, in relation to the present state of
affairs, the undersigned has expressed his Majesty's
desire, that the United States should quickly put
themselves in a situation to take, in the negotiation for
peace which seems on the point of taking place, the
part which their dignity and their interests require,
and that they should lay firm foundations for obtaining
a speedy pacification conformable to the terms of the
alliance, by giving to their Plenipotentiary instructions
the most ample, and powers the most extensive.
It is, in fact, impossible to be too economical of time,
when a correspondence is carried on at so great a distance,
upon a business so important and so liable to be
changed by many incidents impossible to be foreseen.
These observations have still greater force, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
opening of the campaign is approaching, and when the
greatest celerity alone can anticipate the moment of it.
Every day's delay increases the obstacles to the success
of the advantageous plans, which the King has
communicated to the United States. To prolong the
deliberation upon peace may be to reject it. His Majesty,
who thinks that he has deserved the confidence
of the United States, believes, moreover, that he has a
right, after the assurances which Congress have so
often repeated with regard to the uniformity of sentiments
on the subject of his alliance with the United
States, to hope that this subject will be treated with
the promptness which the juncture requires.</p>

<p>The indulgence with which Congress has received
the reflections of the undersigned authorises him to
submit these to their wisdom and prudence. He adds,
that there may be reason to fear that longer delays
may give rise to suspicions, and authorise the assertions
which have been made in Europe, respecting a
division of opinions and sentiments prevailing in
Congress, and strengthen the hope which the enemy
continues to entertain of fomenting this domestic discord,
and at the same time of exciting distrust between
the allies by pretending to treat with each of
the States singly, in order to take them separately in
the snare of their credulity, and to deprive them of
the mutual support which they derive from their
union. It is, moreover, well known, that the preliminary
condition of the Court of London to the United
States would be to renounce the alliance formed with
France, to form an offensive coalition, and to restrain
the commerce of America. The undersigned is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
far from believing, that the wisdom and rectitude of
Congress do not protect them from the effects of this
insidious policy; but their glory and interests seem to
require, that they should prevent the farther establishment
of an opinion, which, more than anything else,
will contribute to support the false expectation and the
obstinacy of the common enemy.</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you, that the season
proper for my departure for France is coming on, and
I take the liberty to request you to persuade Congress
to hasten the time of it as much as possible. Even if
my health did not require this voyage, circumstances
would have induced me to undertake it, because I perceive
how important it is for the common cause, that
in the present situation of affairs, those men alone,
who are informed of the actual state of things and
opinions in America, and who enjoy an unlimited
confidence, should be employed in this negotiation.</p>

<p>Besides, Sir, as I must presume from the wisdom of
Congress, that they have made the same reflections,
that they have fixed, or will fix the choice of their
Minister or Ministers Plenipotentiary, in consequence
of what they must also have felt, that the only way of
proceeding is to choose persons, who should enjoy the

inspires me, by increasing my eagerness to go where
I shall think myself happy to announce, that union

manner Congress will judge proper that I should take

and Vengeur of sixtyfour, by M. de Retz, having

second field regiment, eight hundred and fifty recruits,
and a company of miners."</p>

<p><i>March 6th.</i> "We learn that Admiral Byron has on his
part also received a reinforcement, but we do not know
the force of it. He has not yet undertaken any operation.
He has only twice sailed out with some ships, but he returned
the day after. It is true, that he has not troops
enough to make conquests and to preserve them. Sickness
continues to make great ravages among those that are
at St Lucia."</p>

<p><i>March 9th.</i> "The convoy from France, so much
wished for, has just arrived, attended by many vessels.</p>

<p>"The islands of St Martin and St Bartholomew, which
the English had taken from us, have just been retaken
without much exertion by three of our frigates, and an
end put to the triumph, which our enemies had reaped
from this easy conquest.</p>

<p>"M. de Kersin, the lieutenant of the ship, took two

armed with twentyeight twelve pounders. Her crew consisted
of one hundred and forty men, and her cargo of
provisions and sails, to the value of twentyfive thousand
livres. The store-ship was sheathed with copper. The
other is a privateer of eighteen guns, and with a crew of
seventysix men. Some American privateers have sent
here two prizes coming from Halifax, loaded with fish and
boards. The Minerva has also carried to Cape François
another English frigate of twentyfour guns. The ability
of the captain saved her from the danger of being taken
by a ship of war and three frigates, by which she had been
surprised in a calm."</p>

<p><i>Baltimore, April 2d.</i> "The captain of a sloop, which
has arrived in twentytwo days from Martinique, reports that
sickness had made dreadful ravages in the English army
and fleet at St Lucia, that the two squadrons are supposed
to be nearly equal in force, that the French frigates,
are constantly at sea, often engaging with the English, that
one of the former has taken the frigate Liverpool of
twentysix guns, that in other respects, the situation of the
French is entirely satisfactory to them, and that they appear

<h3><i>Memorial respecting two Spanish Vessels.</i></h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p>Memorial or relation of the injury sustained by two
Captains of Spanish merchantmen, which had sailed, the
one from the river of London, loaded with merchandise
for Cadiz, on the account and at the risk of Spanish merchants;
and the other from the port of Cadiz, loaded
with wines, fruits, cochineal, and other articles, of the
growth of the Spanish territory, belonging also to Spaniards,
bound for London. These two vessels were stopped
by two different privateers, carrying the flag of the
United States of America, and brought the one to Newbury
and the other to Beverly, and then on the demand
of the owners of the privateer, the cargo of one of them
was declared a lawful prize at Boston, the 28th of last
March. They were on the point of passing sentence on
the other at the same place, and not doubting that it will
suffer the same fate as the first, according to the letters
written by the said Captains from the said port of Boston
to Don Juan de Mirales, one of which is without date, and
the other bearing date of the 3d of this month, he has the
honor to impart their contents to his Excellency M. Gerard,
Minister Plenipotentiary of the Court of France to the
United States of America, requesting him to have the
goodness to lay the information before the honorable Congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
of the said States, in order to obtain all the satisfaction
due to the honor of the flag of his Catholic Majesty,
his master, in conformity to the tenor of Articles 14th,
15th, 25th, and 26th, of the treaty of alliance and commerce,
between his Most Christian Majesty and the said
States of America, signed the 6th of February, 1778.
He asks also for the punishment of the infringers of the
treaty, or captors, and requests that the Judges may be
punished, who have unjustly condemned and sentenced as
a lawful prize the said cargo; and provided that the other
vessel has met with the same fate, to sentence them to
the payment of all the indemnities, expenses, damages,
and losses, resulting from the injury sustained by the said
vessels, and the interruption of their voyages, besides the
injury which this occasions to the proprietors of the same;
and this, seeing that at the time in which they were stopped,
his Majesty the King of Spain was at peace with all
the powers of Europe, and consequently had no enemy
to fear; whereas it is possible that since that time, the
state of peace between the Court of Spain and other
powers may have changed, or will change, before the said
Spanish vessels can perform the voyages for which they
were designed; and also the decay of the vessels and of
the merchandise with which they were loaded, and the
great risk offered by a voyage from this continent to any
European port, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>to wit</i>;</p>

<p>Captain Joseph Llanos, by his letter without date,
(although there can be no doubt that it comes from Boston)
says, that he sailed from London with his vessel, (without
mentioning its name) belonging to Don Philip Aguixxe
de San Fadder, loaded with merchandise for Cadiz,
amounting to nearly two hundred thousand current piastres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and that in the course of his voyage he was stopped by a
privateer schooner of Newbury, called the Success, Felix
Trask Captain, belonging to Nathaniel Tracy of said Newbury,
and forcibly brought to this place, notwithstanding,
that he assured the said Captain Tracy, that the cargo
belonged entirely to Spaniards, and that he was convinced
of it by the bills of laden found on board, notwithstanding
which, that the said cargo has been sentenced as a lawful
prize, although the papers exhibit no fraud; as will be
seen by the process, which is copied in order to be
presented to the honorable Congress, to which appeal is
made.</p>

<p>The Captains claim the protection of the honorable
Congress, that of his Excellency M. Gerard, and that of
Don Juan de Miralles; the navigation of the Spanish being
very much injured by the privateers of this continent, there
being three vessels belonging to this nation in the same
situation as the above, brought in by different privateers.
These three vessels also propose to appeal to the honorable
Congress, and are resolved to defend the rights of
the Spanish.</p>

<p>Captain Joachin Garcia de Luca, commander of a
Spanish ship with three masts, her crew Spanish, says, in
his letter dated at Boston, the 3d of the present month,
that he sailed from Cadiz for London, loaded with wines,
oils, cochineal, and fruits, on the account and at the risk
of Spaniards, and that he was stopped, on the 21st of December,
1778, when pursuing his voyage, by a privateer
frigate, with the flag of the United States of America,
which brought him to Beverly; that having learned that
the owners of the said privateer were desirous, that the
cargo of the Spanish vessel should be confiscated, he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
to Boston, where the court of justice sits, before which he
appeared on the 2d of the current month, not knowing at
that time, but he should meet with the same fate, which his
friend Don Joseph de Llanos has suffered with regard to
his cargo, which was condemned on the 28th of last March.</p>

<p>I, Don Juan de Miralles, truly certify, that the above
was extracted from the letters which the Spanish Captains,
Don Joseph de Llanos and Joachin Garcia de Luca, wrote
to me, and which I received on the 19th current, at eight
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The anxiety of the undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary
of France, for the maintenance of the most perfect
harmony, and the care which he has been in the habit of
taking from the commencement of the alliance to establish
such a confidence, as can alone maintain it and conduce to
its prosperity, do not allow him to conceal from the Congress
of the United States the perplexity under which he
labors, with regard to informing his Court of the delays
which the negotiation, commenced in the month of February
last, meets with. It must be allowed, that no affair
so important and so pressing ever experienced so much
delay, and the undersigned declares, that he can see no
reason for warning France and Spain against the sinister
interpretations, with which attempts are made to inspire
them in regard to this conduct. The zeal and the good will
of the petitioner do not suggest to him any other expedient,
than that of requesting Congress to approve of his having
the honor of imparting to them, as he now does, his perplexity
and embarrassment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>He adds, that the Court of France has received intelligences,
that England was resolved to send a considerable
reinforcement of troops to the continent of North America,
and to carry on the war there with all possible vigor, in
order to proceed to the conquest of America at the same
time by force and by intrigue. The King, in consequence
of his attention to whatever may concern the security and
the happiness of his allies, has ordered his Minister Plenipotentiary
to communicate this intelligence to the Congress
of the United States. The undersigned has the
honor to perform this commission by the present note.
He believes that he should add, that his Majesty, adhering
scrupulously to the spirit and principles of the alliance,
which has the independence of the United States as an
essential object, is always resolved to assist America by all
the means, that the resources of his kingdom, and the general
state of affairs, will permit him successively to devote
to this grand object, without being turned from it by the
idea of any conquest for himself.</p>

<p>It is in consequence of these same dispositions and of this
same disinterestedness, that his Majesty, although he has
made no engagement to furnish supplies of money to the
United States, and although the active and direct war
which he is carrying on against the common enemy absorbs
his resources, and ought to exempt him from all
accessory and entirely voluntary expenses, is desirous to
contribute to the re-establishment of the American finances,
so far as his own necessities allow him to do so. He has
thought that he should partly fulfil this object, by securing
the payment of the interest on the loans, which have been
stipulated to be paid in France, presuming that the credit
of one of the public funds of the States would effectually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
contribute to the support of the others, and to the success
of the measures, which the wisdom of Congress may adopt
on this subject. A society of bankers, established under
the authority of the King, has consequently taken upon
itself to make the necessary advances, in the form of a loan
made to America. The undersigned has not yet received
the exact details of this arrangement, but he will have the
honor of communicating them, so soon as he shall receive
them.</p>

<p>The confidence which the King places in the reciprocal
attachment of the United States of America to the alliance,
can alone induce him to determine upon proceedings,
which are useful only to America, burdensome to France,
and destitute of all advantage for her. His Majesty hopes
to receive reciprocal proofs of these sentiments and feelings,
but he neither demands nor expects anything for
himself on the part of Congress. He only desires, that
the States should employ all the resources at their disposal,
in order to provide for their own security and tranquillity.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France, having thought
it his duty to take upon himself to inform the Count d'Estaing
of the desire, which Congress had expressed to him,
that the King's squadron should come to the assistance of
Georgia, this Vice-Admiral has just replied, that the superiority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
of the enemy in the Islands had not till this time,
permitted him to leave those latitudes; but that in consequence
of the intentions of his Majesty, which are, to grant
to the United States, his allies, all the assistance compatible
with the security of his own possessions, and with the
general position of affairs, he proposes to sail immediately
to the Southern coasts of the States, and to exert himself
for the deliverance of Georgia, and the preservation of the
Carolinas. From thence the King's squadron will sail
to the mouth of the Delaware, and its further operations
will depend upon the agreement that shall be made between
Congress and the commander of his Majesty's
forces, and will be calculated for the greatest advantage
of the United States.</p>

<p>The undersigned has no doubt, that this new proof
of his Majesty's generous and disinterested friendship
strengthens the confidence, with which these engagements
and his conduct must have inspired the governments and
people of America. Facts so evident will serve, on the
other hand, to confound those ill-disposed men, who, by
silent and clandestine insinuations, destitute of all proof, and
of all probability, directed solely by private views, and evidently
opposed to the honor and interest of the confederated
Republic, seek to sow distrusts and jealousies, of
which the common enemy alone can reap the advantage.</p>

<p>The undersigned must add to the details above given,
that it is impossible for the Count d'Estaing to carry provisions
from Martinique sufficient for the campaign, which
he proposes to make in the seas of North America. He
hopes that Congress will be pleased to give the most precise
and effectual orders for their being got in readiness
and placed on the coast, so that the squadron may easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
take them on board. The undersigned Minister, hopes
that Congress will be pleased to inform him successively
of what shall be done on this subject, since the said Minister
must be personally responsible for these measures,
the failure of which would expose to the greatest misfortunes
the forces, which the King has destined to bring
direct and immediate assistance to the United States,
although his engagements, which he will always scrupulously
fulfil, do not impose this duty on him.</p>

<h3>MEMORIAL.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p>Don Juan de Miralles, who, under date of the 21st of
April last, had the honor to present a Memorial to his Excellency
M. Gerard, Minister Plenipotentiary of the Court
of France to the United States of America, to inform him
of the proceedings of different privateers, with the flag of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
the said United States, against three vessels lawfully provided
with the Spanish flag, which had sailed, one of them
from London for Cadiz, and the two others from Cadiz
for England, loaded with merchandise belonging, as well
as the said vessels, to subjects of his Catholic Majesty, his
master, which have been carried into different ports of
New England, under the jurisdiction of the Province of
Massachusetts, and that the respective indictments have
been drawn against them before the Court of Admiralty of
the city of Boston, where the cargo of one of the said vessels
which sailed from London has been condemned, to
the profit of the owners and crew of the privateer which
captured her; another of the said vessels, which sailed
from Cadiz, has also been condemned, and there is no
doubt that the third has suffered or will suffer the same
fate.</p>

<p>Don Joseph de Llanos, Captain of the vessel which
sailed from London, and Don Joachin Garcia de Luca,
of the other which sailed from Cadiz, which, as has been
said, have been condemned, have sent me an express, with
copies of the said proceedings, which I have had the honor,
in concurrence with the said M. Gerard, and in his presence,
to deliver to his Excellency the President of the
Honorable Congress, who was so kind as to receive them,
and to offer to lay them before the Honorable Congress,
in order that it may take into consideration an affair of so
great consequence, and be pleased to order what is just,
as well as it regards the interest of the proprietors of the
vessels and cargoes, as the honor due to every neutral flag,
and particularly to that of his Catholic Majesty.</p>

<p>Having learnt, that considering that the said court of
Boston has not agreed to grant to the said condemned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Captains the appeal, which they have made from their sentences
to the said Honorable Congress, and which has
only been referred to the Supreme Court of the said Province
of Massachusetts, they are to judge the said indictment
definitively, in the last resort, and that there is no
doubt that the first sentences pronounced by the Court of
Admiralty of Boston will be confirmed; the said Don
Juan de Miralles earnestly requests his Excellency, the said
M. Gerard, that he would be pleased to interpose his influence
and his mediation with the said Honorable Congress,
in order that it may have the goodness to pass a resolution
ordering the said Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and
every other tribunal, to suspend every proceeding and
determination with regard to the aforesaid three Spanish
vessels and their cargoes, until the said Honorable Congress
shall have decided definitively on this affair, and that
this may be done soon, so that the order, which it may
be pleased to give, may arrive at Boston before the said
5th of June next, which is the time at which the said
causes are to be judged definitively and in the last resort.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 22d, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France, not having
been hitherto informed by Congress of the result of their
deliberations upon the important overtures, which have
formed for more than three months the constant subject
of his representations, has reason to presume, that the
resolutions relative to them have not yet been passed.
Delays, so long and so unnatural, in a matter so clear, and
in a juncture which requires so much celerity, and which
so essentially concerns the United States, have rendered
the undersigned apprehensive lest some doubt had arisen,
either as to the main point of the matter, or as to the manner
of proceeding, or as to the dispositions and views of
the King; and as the said Minister is instructed to conceal
from Congress nothing that can be useful to the interests of
the United States, he asks permission to submit to them the
summary of the most essential things, which seemed to him
to deserve attention in the further course of its deliberations.</p>

<p>It is well known, that the direct and essential object of
the alliance, which subsists between his Most Christian
Majesty and the United States, is to <i>maintain effectually
the liberty, the sovereignty, and the independence, absolute
and unlimited, of the said States, as well with respect to
government as to commerce</i>, and consequently, the territorial
rights belonging to sovereignty. To this object all the
efforts and proceedings of the King are constantly tending.
It is in order to attain it, and to procure for the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
America the power of this valuable independence, and the
cessation of the evils and dangers under which an active
and obstinate war makes them groan, that his Majesty has
undertaken a difficult and expensive war against England,
without any view of personal interest, and even with the
refusal of the advantages which the United States appeared
ready to grant him. He has already given brilliant proofs,
that his friendship does not confine itself to the mere fulfilment
of his engagements. He is in fact disposed to give
to the United States all the assistance compatible with the
situation of his own affairs, and with the general state of
things, and he regards the interests of the United States as
his own, in everything that relates to the object of the alliance,
and that is conformable to the invariable principles
on which his reciprocal connexions with the United States
are founded. It is in consequence of his attention to execute
literally the treaty of alliance, that he has not lost a
moment in informing Congress of the overtures relative to
the projected pacification, in entreating them to take without
delay that part in this negotiation, which the dignity and
interests of the United States require. He has moreover
repeated to Congress the promise, that he would not treat
with the common enemy, without making it a primary and
essential condition, that the independence of the United
States should be acknowledged, conformably to the stipulations
of the treaty of alliance. His Majesty has at the
same time ordered his Minister Plenipotentiary to lay
before Congress some considerations relative to the state
of affairs, and particularly to observe to them, that the alliance,
unless victorious, cannot dictate terms to the common
enemy. The undersigned has executed these orders
either verbally or in writing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident then, that his Majesty desires only the tranquillity
and prosperity of America, upon the foundation of
an honorable and firm peace, conformable to the stipulations
of the treaty of alliance. He rejects every idea of
conquest and acquisition of territory for himself. In order
promptly to attain this advantageous object, and to fulfil
his engagements, he is disposed to carry on the war with
vigor, if the common enemy refuses the pacific system,
which his Majesty has announced to the whole world, and
which the United States adopted on signing the alliance.
But in case that the perseverance of the Court of London
in the desire to subdue, or to conquer America, should
prolong the calamities of the war, his Majesty will consider
himself at liberty to concert with the United States all the
further measures adapted to this new order of things, and
conformably to the mutual interests of the allies and of the
common cause. It is thus that the King fulfils, and proposes
to fulfil, the duties resulting from Articles 1st and
8th of the treaty of alliance, by urging on one side the
United States to participate in the negotiation, which can
conduct to the conclusion of a truce and of a peace, by
making common cause with the said States, and on the
other side, by enabling the two allies mutually to assist
each other by their good offices, their councils, and their
forces, as circumstances may require; in fine, by showing
his perseverance, conformably to Article 8th, in the resolution
not to lay down arms till independence shall have
been formally or tacitly acknowledged. But as this last stipulation
limits his Majesty's engagements on this subject
to the very time of this acknowledgment, if England immediately
agrees to this essential condition, his Most Christian
Majesty will have fulfilled all his positive and direct
engagements in relation to the conclusion of peace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>It follows from these observations,</p>

<p>1st. That the King has engaged to procure for the
United States, by means of arms, the acknowledgment of
their independence, and that his Majesty is faithful to fulfil
this obligation, and even disposed to lend them assistance,
to which he is not obliged by the treaty.</p>

<p>2dly. That he has made no other engagements than
those expressed in the stipulations of the treaty.</p>

<p>3dly. That the United States have neither title nor
right to require anything more, and that if they wish to
persuade him to further engagements, it can only be voluntary
on his part, and by uniting <i>reciprocal counsels</i>, conformably
to the expression of Article 1st of the treaty, and
as is proper for <i>good and faithful allies</i>. Even in this case,
it is impossible to foresee the state of things and minds in
Europe, or to judge what measures the important care of
maintaining his reputation, and the system of equity and
moderation, which he has made the fundamental principle
of his reign, may require on his Majesty's part. These
considerations seem particularly due to an ally, when he
has contracted gratuitous obligations without any reciprocal
advantages.</p>

<p>4thly. By uniting the expressions of Articles 11th and
12th, it will be seen, that the success of the war being
alone able to fix the fate of empires, it has been found impossible
on concluding the treaty of alliance to determine
the possessions that the United States may obtain on making
peace; that consequently, the engagement of France
can only be conditional and eventual on this subject; that
she is not now held to any particular engagement, in relation
to these possessions, whether real or pretended; and
that this obligation will not commence till the time in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the possessions of the United States shall be fixed by the
cessation of the war.</p>

<p>5thly. In fine, it is indispensable to add to these considerations,
that when any doubt arises as to the expressions,
the extent and the application of the stipulations of
a treaty, the laws of reason, and of universal justice, as
well as the rules of a good and faithful alliance, decide,
that an ally has no right to interpret it arbitrarily and partially;
that the attempt would at the same time offend the
dignity, and destroy the confidence of his ally; that neither
of them can in fact arrogate to himself the superiority in
connexions, which ought to be equal and reciprocal; that
it is only by a friendly explanation, by a formal agreement,
that these doubts can be removed, and the exact meaning
of treaties determined; that in short, this method would
become still more indispensable, if it should happen, that
the pretensions of one of the parties were founded only
upon farfetched inductions, subject to discussion and contradiction,
and would tend to alter the essential and fundamental
system of an alliance.</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France is fully confident,
that the Congress of the United States, knowing the
laws of proceedings, and the respect which Sovereigns
mutually owe to each other, will observe them in their conduct
towards his Most Christian Majesty; but the important,
critical, and pressing juncture, in which the affairs of
the alliance stand at the present moment, imposes on the
undersigned Minister the sacred duty of contributing, as
much as lies in his power, to hasten the resolutions of Congress,
to prevent all mistakes and every subject of misunderstanding,
to preserve the most perfect harmony and
uniformity of views and sentiments, concerning the accomplishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of the advantageous stipulations of the alliance,
and thus to deceive the expectation of the common enemy,
who henceforth founds his principal hopes on the divisions,
which he is intent upon fomenting. In fine, one of
the objects of this Memorial is, to prove, solemnly, the faithful
and friendly conduct of the King in this juncture, his
Majesty hoping, that the knowledge of this conduct will
confirm the governments and people of America in the
sentiments of confidence, which the proceedings of his said
Majesty have already inspired. It is only by thus placing
before the eyes of Congress the indubitable principles expressed
above, that the Minister Plenipotentiary of France
thought that he could fulfil his duties to the King, his master,
and to the alliance, and protect from all reproach his
zeal for the common cause between France and America.</p>

<p>If he has deceived himself in his conjectures, as to the
immediate and apparent utility of his mode of proceeding,
he begs Congress to accept his excuses for having consumed
time of so much value, and he flatters himself, that
knowing his attachment to the alliance, and to the United
States, it will attribute his conduct to these sentiments
alone.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I avail myself of the first respite, which my sickness
allows me, to congratulate you as well as Congress upon
the resolution, which I am assured they have taken, in relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
to their finances. The execution of the system,
which appeared connected with this first operation of a tax,
will show to your friends and your enemies the extent of
your resources, your firmness, and your ability to make a
suitable and efficacious use of them. The eagerness with
which the people seemed to expect an arrangement of this
kind, gives beforehand the proof of their favorable dispositions
and of their good will. This state of things, Sir,
cannot but strengthen the very friendly intentions of the
King, my master, by the confidence with which your own
efforts, and the displaying of the resources of America, will
inspire him in your dispositions. It will only remain for
you to show vigor in your military operations, in order to
destroy the hope entertained by the common enemy, of
conquering America; then everything will inspire us with
the hope of soon seeing the happy day dawn, in which
America will enjoy independence, together with the advantages
and delights of peace. Congress has received all
the possible assurances of the King's, my master's, desire to
hasten that moment, and he is convinced, that Congress
will place no obstacle in the way.</p>

<p><i>May 24th.</i> Information being given to Congress of
some outrages and wanton barbarities, committed on subjects
of France by the enemy, on their landing in Virginia,
the following resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>Whereas it has been represented to Congress, that the
enemy at the time of, and since their landing in Virginia,
have perpetrated the most unnecessary, wanton, and outrageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
barbarities, on divers of the citizens of that State,
as well as on several of the subjects of his Most Christian
Majesty residing therein, deliberately putting many of them
to death in cool blood, after they had surrendered, abusing
women, and desolating the country with fire,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Governor of Virginia, be requested
to cause diligent inquiry to be made into the truth of the
above representations, and to transmit to Congress the evidence
he may collect on the subject.</p>

<p>Resolved, That Congress will retaliate for cruelties and
violations of the laws of nations committed in these States,
against the subjects of his Most Christian Majesty, in like
manner and measure as if committed against citizens of the
said States, and that the protection of Congress shall be on
all occasions equally extended to both.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received with the most lively satisfaction the letter
with which you honored me on the 24th of this month,
as well as the resolutions of Congress of the same date,
which accompanied it, and which relate to the atrocious
actions committed by the enemy's troops in Virginia, which
violate equally the laws of war established between civilized
nations, and the first principles of humanity, and attack
the foundations of all human society.</p>

<p>The whole world cannot but be convinced of the justice
of the necessary measures to which the conduct of the

common enemy compels Congress to have recourse, in
order if possible to put an end to such horrible excesses.</p>

<p>I must confine myself here, Sir, to requesting you to
place before Congress this assurance of the sensibility with
which the King, my master, and the whole French nation
will receive the strong proof of friendship, union, and identity
of feelings and interests, which the United States give
in declaring, that they will make no distinction, in this respect,
between their own subjects and those of their ally.
This will give the common enemy a new evidence of the
inviolability of the alliance which unites the two nations,
and will afford the French, who have already given so
many proofs of their individual attachment to the sentiments
of the alliance, and of their zeal for the United
States, a new motive of encouragement. By thus increasing
more and more the connexions and the mutual confidence,
the means of braving the effects of the ambition and

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France, in consequence
of the sentiment and the views, which have prompted his
previous representations, has the honor to observe to the
representatives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled, that independently of the principal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
direct interest of the confederated republic in the overtures
of pacification, which the undersigned has been ordered to
make to Congress, the general good of the alliance urges
with all possible earnestness the hastening of the resolution
of the said States. It is in fact only by enabling the
Court of Spain to bring its mediation to its critical and
decisive point, that it can be hoped that this power, convinced
of the injustice of the views and of the ambition of
England, will join the alliance, acknowledge the independence
of the United States, and take an active part in the
war. On the contrary, by delaying without communicating
to the parties interested the motives which induce them
to it, the States will be in danger of fatiguing this power,
which keeps on foot the forces of the whole monarchy,
principally with a view to give respectability to a mediation
which appears to be neglected; they incur the risk of
cooling the good will of his Catholic Majesty, and perhaps
of alienating him as much by delays, as if resolutions, contrary
to the system which he has appeared disposed to
favor by his mediation, should give him lawful reasons for
changing his conduct.</p>

<p>The alliance will thus be deprived of a decisive support,
which the goodness of its cause, the wisdom of its conduct,
and the close union subsisting between France and Spain
seemed to promise it. Moreover, the suspension of the
said resolutions operates equally in another point of view,
in a manner the most disadvantageous for the alliance in
general, and for France in particular. On the one side,
in fact, the expectation of the resolutions of Congress
necessarily infuses into plans and measures an uncertainty
injurious to the common good, and if the Count d'Estaing
does not carry into execution the plan of coming upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
American coast, it can only be attributed to this cause.
On the other hand, the season is already so far advanced,
that this same uncertainty, by destroying the hope of seeing
Spain declare herself during the course of the present
campaign, leaves France alone exposed to the efforts of the
principal body of the enemy's forces.</p>

<p>The wisdom of Congress, and the faithful attachment
which they show on every occasion, in a manner as conspicuous
as it is satisfactory to the alliance, and the respect
which they have always expressed for Spain, do not permit
a doubt as to the attention which they will be pleased
to give to considerations of such importance. The present
Memorial is the last tribute that the zeal of the Minister
Plenipotentiary of France will allow him to consecrate to
the duty of facilitating and accelerating, as much as lies in
his power, the deliberations of Congress, by suggesting
considerations which might have such an influence.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, June 21st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor
to represent to the Congress of the United States of America,
that the daily experience of several ports of the continent
proves how prejudicial the want of the proper regulations
for maintaining the immunity of the flag, which is
the foundation of a free commerce, is to navigators, to
French merchants, and even to the interests and to the
honor of the French nation. The treaty of commerce has
foreseen this state of things, and has expressed the wish of
the two parties to remedy it. The undersigned would
have proposed to Congress, some time ago, to enter upon
this negotiation, had he not perceived that their time was
occupied by subjects of greater importance; but as the
evil increases daily, it becomes indispensable and urgent
to provide a remedy for it, at least with regard to the
most pressing subjects, and by provisional regulations,
which will have no force till the contract, stipulated by the
treaty of commerce, is made.</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary consequently thinks it his
duty to lay before Congress the annexed plan, and to propose
a method, which seemed to him calculated to effect
this object.</p>

<p>Several States, perceiving the inconveniences of the
present uncertainty, seemed disposed to provide a remedy
for it by domestic laws; but the undersigned has not been
willing to urge them, without being previously informed of
the sentiments of Congress on this subject. He consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
requests that body to be pleased to inform him of
them, and if they think proper that the daily complaints
should be redressed by provisional regulations, while waiting
till the subject shall be acted upon by a convention, to
recommend this matter itself to the Legislatures of the
several States. The regulations which they may make
will show by experience, whether they are calculated to
effect this object. They will throw light upon the rules
observed among all commercial nations, and will give to
the United States in general an opportunity of becoming
acquainted with the manner in which the commerce
between the two nations can be regulated, according to the
principles of justice and equality, which should form the
foundation of all the connexions that shall subsist between
them, and according to the principles and forms which
vary in different States.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, July 5th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France, has already
had the honor to recommend to Congress the request
made by the King's navy agent in relation to the expedition
of the ship Defence, loaded with provisions for Cape
François. He renews his entreaties by the present Memorial.
The quantity of provisions on board this vessel
is so inconsiderable, particularly considering the abundance
of old grain which we see now, that the undersigned hopes
that Congress will think that the exportation of them may
be allowed, without injury to the service of the army or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
the public. The undersigned, however, offers to have
these same provisions received, so as to be deducted from
the quantity promised for his Majesty's squadron, and particularly
the flour, on account of the thousand barrels, to
which the eighteen thousand, promised for the same service,
have been reduced. The want of provisions is so
great at Cape François, particularly in the vessels of
Count d'Estaing's squadron, which are stationed there to
protect the reciprocal commerce, that the said Minister is
ready to subscribe to whatever conditions Congress shall
think proper to impose with regard to this expedition.
But he requests with the greatest earnestness, that they
would be pleased not to defer giving a positive answer, in
order not to increase, if its decision is in the negative, the
costs and expenses which the King will be obliged to pay
to the proprietors and fitters out of the said vessel.</p>

<p>With regard to its destination, the undersigned had
thought that he could flatter himself, that his character and
conduct would prevent the doubts which a member of
Congress has communicated in writing to the King's navy
agent. Nevertheless, as so weighty a suspicion, declared
in so serious a manner, and impeaching the probity and
fidelity of the officers of the King, acting immediately under
the direction of the said Minister, cannot have been suggested
to Congress without important reasons, the undersigned
entreats and requests them to be pleased to cause
an account to be rendered of the reasons of his suspicions,
and of the facts upon which they may have been grounded.
The undersigned requests further, that the result of this
verification may be communicated to him, in order that he
may be in a situation to take the further part, that the dignity
of the King, his respect for Congress, his regard for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
the public interest of America, and the delicacy which
ought to characterise the conduct of every public man, may
require.</p>

<p>The undersigned makes the same request, and for the
same reasons, with regard to the accusation made to Congress,
that the vessels, which have been fitted out in the
name of the King, have been loaded with quantities of
flour on individual account. He declares that his first
rule has always been to cause the whole of the vessels to
be freighted on his Majesty's account; but if any frauds
have been committed in this matter, it is of equal importance
to the public good, and to the dignity of the King,
that its authors should be known, in order to prevent
further frauds. The delegates to Congress, by a verbal
declaration made to the King's navy agent, have confined
this imputation to one vessel alone, but it is not less important
that the fact should be verified.</p>

<p>Besides, although the Minister Plenipotentiary of France
insists on this point, in order to make these odious imputations
fall on those who may deserve them, he could have
contented himself with declaring, that not having the right
of police and inspection over the proprietors, owners, and
Captains of the American vessels, which have been employed
in these transportations, <a name="ought" id="ought"></a>and who ought to be better
acquainted than strangers with the laws of the country, it
is only the officers of the State, appointed to receive the
declarations of the ships which sail from the ports, who
can, in examining the cargoes, determine the frauds which
may have been committed; and that without directly and
positively blaming the officers of the King, they cannot be
made responsible for frauds, which it is not in their power
to prevent. Very far from desiring any connivance on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
part of the officers or of the governments of the different
States of America, the undersigned earnestly desires, that
they would be pleased to execute with vigor the powers
which belong to them, and the laws which may have reference
to these subjects.</p>

<p>The undersigned hopes that Congress will be pleased
not to defer its resolution, whatever it may be, respecting
the ship Defence, till the verification of these facts. The
two affairs have nothing in common, and the Minister
Plenipotentiary, in repeating his offers expressed above,
flatters himself that Congress, if they think proper to permit
this expedition, will find that these arrangements can
be made even after the departure of this vessel.</p>

<p class="signed">
GERARD.
</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<p>This Memorial being read, it was immediately</p>

<p>Resolved, that it be recommended to his Excellency
the Governor of Maryland to permit the ship Defence,
which is loaded with provisions for the fleet of his Most
Christian Majesty, to depart and carry her cargo to the
place of her destination, and that care be taken that she
carry no other provisions than the above, and what may be
necessary for the crew.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, July 5th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor
to represent to Congress, that faithful to the promises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
which that body has asked for, on his part, in relation to
the purchase of provisions destined for the squadron, which
the King sent last year to the assistance of the United
States, he has never authorised any purchase except
through the very overseers appointed by Congress, or
without giving notice of the operation to the members of
the committees intrusted with this business. He has declared
to them several times, that the provisions bought on
the account, and with the money of the King, would always
remain at the disposal of Congress, either for the public
service, or for that of the American army. The undersigned
hopes, that their members will be witnesses of it to
Congress. Delicacy has been carried so far, that it has
been preferred to expose the King's squadron to the want
of provisions, which it has procured only in consequence of
some happy accidents, rather than to break through an arrangement
which Congress had judged necessary. The
same principle has guided the conduct which has been pursued
in the last place, when the undersigned, by his knowledge
of the chief motives of Congress, having been obliged
to demand the assurance of a certain quantity of provisions,
the difficulty of circumstances induced him to combine
purchases by way of commerce with the direct measures
which Congress has judged proper to take. As Congress
must have been informed of all that has taken place on this
subject, the undersigned will not introduce it again here,
and he will abstain from all reflection.</p>

<p>He confines himself to representing to Congress, that
the produce of these private purchases is reduced to a
very small quantity, by the obstacles which the continental
officers have thrown in their way, and by the seizure, by
authority, of the articles bought, as well as by other similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
events; and the agents employed on the King's account,
being thus deprived of the security and of the power which
every American citizen, and every foreign merchant enjoys,
and the property of the King being so uncertain and
exposed, the undersigned begs Congress to be pleased to
cause all the provisions bought on the account and with
the money of his Majesty, to be placed in the hands of
the officers whom they shall judge proper to appoint for
this purpose, in order that Congress may dispose of them
in such manner as their own prudence and the public
interest shall dictate; the undersigned declaring, that from
the moment in which he was informed of these proceedings
and of these obstacles, he has given order to put an end
to every kind of purchase and supply of provisions. He
annexes here the note of the provisions now in the hands
of the King's agents; and if the commissions given heretofore
have produced a greater quantity of them, he will
have the honor to give notice of it to Congress, according
as he shall be informed of it himself.</p>

<p>But he must at the same time call the attention of Congress
to the proposition, which he had the honor to make
to them by the Memorial which contains the request for
this new supply, that is to say, that they would be pleased
to declare, whether the Minister Plenipotentiary of France
may reckon upon the quantity of provisions, which are necessary
for the important object which he has had the
honor to communicate to Congress. In order to facilitate
the success of his measures on this subject, the undersigned
confines himself at the present time to requesting, that the
quantity of five thousand barrels of flour may be immediately
held in readiness. The remainder can be furnished
in the course of September next, from grain the product
of this year's harvest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>The reasons alleged in the said Memorial compel the
undersigned to repeat to Congress the formal demand of
a prompt and explicit answer, with which he has not hitherto
been honored. Congress has too much wisdom for
any one to allow himself to set forth to it all the inconveniences
which might result to America, and to the alliance
from the least delay. The reports hitherto communicated
are so uncertain, that it is impossible to make them the
foundation of a confidence, which the experience of the
past does not encourage, unless Congress authorises them
by its sanction. A formal and explicit assurance on the
part of Congress can alone effect an object so important,
upon which the Minister Plenipotentiary of France has
insisted since the month of May, and which the advancement
of the season renders still more critical and pressing.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF A COMMITTEE RESPECTING A CONFERENCE
WITH THE MINISTER OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, July 10th, 1779.</p>

<p>The President informed Congress, that the Minister of
France had communicated to him certain intelligence,
about which it would, in his opinion, be expedient for
Congress to confer with the Minister.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the honorable M. Gerard be informed
by the President, that Congress are desirous of
conferring with him in a committee of the whole, on the
subject of the intelligence communicated by him to the
President, and that if agreeable to him, a private audience
be had on Monday next, at 12 o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Monday, July 12th.</i> The President informed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
house, that he had communicated to the Minister of France
the resolution of Saturday, and that the Minister had
agreed to meet Congress, in a committee of the whole, at
12 o'clock. Whereupon Congress was resolved into a
committee of the whole, and had a conference with the
Minister, and on the 14th of July, Mr Laurens, chairman
of the committee, reported,</p>

<p>That in obedience to the order of Congress, the committee
of the whole have conferred with the Minister Plenipotentiary
of France, who introduced the conference by
saying, that he had received some despatches from his
Court, which he was ordered to communicate to Congress,
but that he expected no answer. That though it was not
the usual practice to offer communications of this nature in
writing, yet as it had been intimated to him by the President,
that this mode would be most agreeable to Congress,
he had committed the heads of them to paper, not as a
Memorial, but merely for the assistance of the memory, in
a form to which the term of "<i>ad statum legendi</i>" is appropriated
by the usage of the Courts of Europe; that in
reading the said paper he would take the liberty of making
some explanations and reflections.</p>

<p>That he then proceeded to read the paper herewith delivered,
marked No. 1, divided into seven Articles, and at
the close of each separate Article he added explanations
and reflections, the substance of which the committee have
endeavored to recollect, and have committed to writing in
the paper marked No 2.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p class="translation">NO. I.</p>

<p class="translation"><i>Ad statum legendi.</i></p>

<p>1st. The King has approved all the overtures, which
were made by his Minister Plenipotentiary to the Honorable
Congress, respecting the affairs of M. de Beaumarchais.
Therefore a line ought to be drawn between the
stores, which this gentleman has been permitted to take
out of the royal magazine, for which he has made himself
debtor to the department of war, and between those articles
which the same gentleman has bought in the common way
of trade for the use of the United States.</p>

<p>2dly. A hint having been given to the Minister Plenipotentiary,
that Congress desire to recruit their ships in
France, from the English prisoners there, the Court in
consequence of his representations is willing to facilitate
this mode of recruiting seamen.</p>

<p>3dly. The King and Ministry were extremely pleased
with the resolution, which Congress has taken, to maintain
only one Minister Plenipotentiary at this Court, as well as
with the exclusive appointment of so steady and honest a
man, and so firm and solid a patriot, as Dr Franklin.</p>

<p>4thly. The Congress has given very great satisfaction to
the Court of France, by the timely and spirited step, which
was taken to disavow a certain ill-grounded and pernicious
doctrine, relating to the mutual obligations of the allies, to
conclude no truce or peace without the knowledge or consent
of <a name="each" id="each"></a>each other. The Court of France is of opinion,
that this doctrine could only be maintained by those men,
whose aim it was by any means to weaken the ties of the
alliance, and to create disgust and diffidence between the
allies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>5thly. The Court has received with some surprise the
intelligence, that Congress has published the treaties concluded
with it, without the previous knowledge and consent
of the party interested. It is not to be denied, that
such a proceeding is but little consistent with reason, and
with the general practice of Courts and nations. Nevertheless,
this observation involves not any kind of reproach,
but the King thinks, that so noble and generous a system
of politics could but produce desirable effects by its publication.</p>

<p>6thly. The intelligence, that in the first month of last
winter there were no adequate preparations made in America
towards a vigorous and successful campaign, was
received at Versailles with all the concern, which the danger
of the United States and the prolongation of the present
contest can create in the most friendly mind. The
Court of France is fully in the opinion, that the exertions
of the United States are necessary to bring the common
enemy to a proper sense of all the disappointments which
he shall meet with.</p>

<p>7thly. The Court, being desirous to acquaint Congress
exactly with the state of affairs relating to the common
cause, would not delay to inform this honorable body, that
the Court of London, showing on one side dispositions to
a reconciliation with France, rejects on the other side the
very idea of a formal and explicit acknowledgment of
the independence of the United States, which his Most
Christian Majesty perseveres to hold up as a preliminary
and essential condition. The behavior of the common
enemy in this respect rendered a great deal more probable
the conjecture, which was communicated to Congress
some time ago, that the point of honor and pride of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
King of England will be the greatest obstacle to the conclusion
of peace upon those explicit terms; and perhaps
the manner of overcoming this difficulty will of course
become the most decisive object of the deliberations of
Congress, when this honorable body shall determine to
make peace, whatever middle way may be hit upon, that
England shall treat with the United States as with a free
people, and evacuate immediately all the territories belonging
to them.</p>

<h3>NO. II.</h3>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The Substance of what the Minister said at the Conference
in explanation of the several Articles in the foregoing
Paper, entitled "ad statum legendi," as reported by
the Committee.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1. From the bills and accounts with which
Congress have been furnished by M. de Beaumarchais,
Congress will be enabled to distinguish those articles
which were drawn from the royal magazines, and those
which he supplied in the way of trade. For these last,
Congress will without doubt make remittances to M. de
Beaumarchais in their own way, to enable him to perform
the contracts he has entered into as a merchant. That
for the former articles, the King, his master, taking upon
himself to be creditor to the United States, would wait
until Congress shall find it convenient to make compensation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 2. Though his Court had not resolved to retaliate
upon the prisoners taken by the common enemy,
yet for the reasons assigned, the King, his master, had
assented to the proposal. But in carrying this matter into
execution it would be proper to take such precautions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
to give such orders to the Captains, or other persons employed
in this business, that it may be managed with
prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 3. There is every reason to believe, that
Congress will very soon receive proofs of the confidence,
which his Court was always willing to show to the servants
of these States. The personal character of Dr Franklin
will enable the Court to act with a frankness becoming the
alliance, and they will have no occasion to withhold any
more the secrets which may interest the United States and
the alliance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 4. The King, his master, after this explicit
step, relies with the highest confidence upon the candor
and faithfulness of Congress, in understanding as well as
in executing the treaty, and in rejecting every arbitrary and
unnatural interposition or construction, which false, subtle,
or designing men can contrive. Congress by their own
feelings must be sensible, that such interpretations and constructions
are always hurtful, against common decency and
dignity, and may oftentimes endanger mutual confidence,
and of course the very existence of a treaty. But the
sense Congress has manifested in this particular affair gives
his Court the greatest hopes, that there will be no further
motive for the painful reflections, which that affair gave
rise to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 5. He begged leave to add, that this publication
interfered with the situation of affairs in Europe,
and was in a certain degree disadvantageous to the common
cause, because it gave the common enemy a full
knowledge of our system, and our mutual engagements,
without procuring us any reason to guess at their views
and resolutions. Happily these inconveniences have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
been felt, and ample compensation has been obtained by
convincing the people of America, not only that the treaty
was just and equal, but that the heavy task which France
had taken upon her was magnanimous, gratuitous and
without reward. The whole world was at the same time
convinced, that war, conquest, and ambition, were not the
objects of the alliance, nor of any of the allies, but only the
peaceable enjoyment of the sovereignty, liberty, security,
and independence of these United States. And this conviction
gave much honor, credit, and consideration to the
alliance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 6. On this he observed, that he had endeavored
since last fall, by order of his Court, to impress upon
every mind, that England will never evacuate New York
willingly, and could only be brought by proper exertions
on the part of America to think seriously of granting independence.
He believed that Congress had adopted a system
so conformable to their engagements and to the situation
of affairs, his Court was better informed than he was.
But without reflecting on past events, the King hopes, that
his amicable apprehensions will be overcome by the success
of the campaign; that henceforth the United States
will follow the example set them by his Majesty, and that
they will exert themselves in their own cause, as his Majesty
exerts himself for their sakes and in their cause, which
he has adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 7. He said he was authorised to tell Congress
in confidence, that this reflection is the result of the observations
which the Court of Spain made upon the conduct
of England throughout her negotiation of mediation; that
the British Ministry seem to be solicitous to be reconciled
with France, and to keep up this negotiation; that from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
thence probable hopes may be entertained of their internal
disposition to peace, but at the same time they reject with
haughtiness the formal acknowledgment of the independence
insisted on by France and Spain. New orders
have been given to the Spanish Ambassador at London, to
ascertain as nearly as possible those dispositions. In these
circumstances, the King, his master, ordered him to communicate
this intelligence to the United States, that they
may, if they think proper, take under consideration, if it
would not be expedient to give their Plenipotentiary instructions
and full powers, founded upon the necessity of
the conjuncture and upon the treaty of alliance, the express
and formal terms of which are, that peace shall not be
made without an express or tacit acknowledgment of the
sovereignty, and, consequently, and <i>à fortiori</i>, of the rights
inherent in sovereignty, as well as of the independency of
the United States in matters of government and of commerce.</p>

<p>This substantial alternative in an engagement, which is a
mere gratuitous gift, without any compensation or stipulation,
ought, indeed, never to be forgotten in a negotiation
for peace. France foresaw the extreme difficulties, which
a formal and explicit acknowledgment might meet with.
She knew by her own experience in similar contests, in
which she has been deeply concerned, respecting the Republics
of Holland, Genoa, and the Swiss cantons, how
tenacious monarchs are, and how repugnant to pronounce
the humiliating <i>formula</i>. It was only obtained for Holland
<i>tacitly</i>, after a war of thirty years, and <i>explicitly</i> after
a resistance of seventy. To this day, Genoa and the
Swiss cantons have obtained no renunciation or acknowledgment,
either tacit or formal, from their former sovereigns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
But they enjoy their sovereignty and independence
only under the guarantee of France. His Court
thought it important to provide, that difficulties of this
nature, which consist merely in words, should not delay
or prevent America from enjoying the thing itself.</p>

<p>From these considerations arose the very important and
explicit stipulation in the treaty, which he just now mentioned,
and which has received the sanction of the United
States. The circumstances seem such as call for the application
of the alternative of tacit or explicit acknowledgement.
All these considerations are adduced, that Congress
may, if they think proper, consider whether the literal
execution of the treaty in this point is not become
necessary, and whether the safety and happiness of the
American people, as well as the essential principles of the
alliance, are not intimately connected with the resolutions
that may be taken on this subject. And it remains with
the prudence of Congress to examine, whether instructions
upon some particular conditions may not frustrate the salutary
purpose of the treaty of alliance, relative to a tacit
acknowledgment which the situation of affairs may require.</p>

<p>In thus executing, continued he, the orders I have received,
I cannot omit observing, that these orders were
given with the full presumption, that the business, which I
laid before Congress in February last, would have been
settled long before these despatches should come to my
hands. However sensibly my Court will be disappointed
in its expectations, I shall add nothing to the information
and observations, which, with the warmest zeal for the
interests and honor of both countries, and by the duties of
my office, and my instructions, I found myself bound to
deliver from time to time to Congress, in the course of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
business. The apprehension of giving new matter to those
who endeavor to blame Congress is a new motive for me to
be silent. I beg only to remind this honorable body of the
aforesaid information and reflections, and particularly of
those which I had the honor to deliver in an assembly similar
to the present. I shall only insist on a single point,
which I established then and since, in one of my Memorials,
namely, the manifest and striking necessity of enabling
Spain, by the determination of just and moderate
terms, to press upon England with her good offices and
bring her mediation to an issue, in order that we may know
whether we are to expect peace or war. This step is
looked upon in Europe as immediately necessary. It was
the proper object of the message I delivered in February
last. I then established the strong reasons, which require
that at the same time, and without delay, proper terms
should be offered to his Catholic Majesty, in order to reconcile
him perfectly to the American interest. I did not
conceal, that it was to be feared, that any condition inconsistent
with the established system of the alliance, which
is the binding and only law of the allies, and contrary to
the line of conduct, which Spain pursued in the course of
her mediation, would lead her to drop the mediation, and
prevent his Catholic Majesty, by motives of honor and of
faithfulness, from joining in our common cause, and from
completing the intended triumvirate. No loss, no unhappy
event, could be so heavy upon the alliance as this. Indeed,
although the British forces are already kept in check by
the combined efforts of France and America, it is nevertheless
evident, that the accession of Spain can only give to
the alliance a decided superiority, adequate to our purposes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
and free us from the fatal chance, that a single unlucky
event may overthrow the balance.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<p>The committee then taking notice of what the Minister
had said concerning a tacit assurance of the independence
of these States, and the reluctance of the King of Great
Britain to make an express acknowledgment thereof, requested
to know his sense concerning the manner in which
such tacit assurance could be given. To which, he premising
that what he should now say ought to be considered
only as his private sentiments, replied, that the British Court
would probably endeavor to avoid an express acknowledgment,
by imitating precedents, that had occurred in Europe
on similar occasions, instancing the cases of the Swiss cantons,
and the United Provinces of the Netherlands; that
the mode adopted in the latter case had been for the Archduke,
to whom the King of Spain had transferred his right
of sovereignty, to treat with them "as with free and independent
States." And that with respect to the cantons,
France had not been able to obtain for them in the treaty
of Munster any other than a declaration, that they should
be in possession of as full liberty and exemption from the
empire, and be in no manner subject to the jurisdiction
thereof. But that in his opinion the circumstances of these
States, and the manner in which they had conducted their
opposition, would justify their expecting a more full declaration.</p>

Philadelphia, July 26th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has received
with gratitude the permission, which the Congress of the
United States has been pleased to grant him, for the expedition
of the ship Defence. His Court will be very sensible
of the regard, which Congress have been pleased to
pay to the situation of the vessels of war stationed at Cape
François.</p>

<p>The said Minister takes the liberty of reminding Congress
of the request, which he made in one of his Memorials,
dated the 5th of this month, relative to the accusations,
which have been made before the whole House, of
frauds which were thought to have been practised with
regard to the cargo of the ship Defence, and of other
vessels loaded with provisions for the French squadron.
The undersigned has, by writing, on the 17th of this month,
urged the committee intrusted with this verification, to be
pleased to hasten its report, and he takes the liberty of
addressing the same request to the Congress of the United
States itself. Congress is also referred to the reflections
contained in his said Memorial of the 5th instant.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has received
the resolution of Congress, dated the 15th of this month,
in relation to the supplies of provisions destined for the
squadron of the King. He requests Congress to accept
his thanks for the measures, which have been taken to
effect this important object. He is only under the necessity
of representing, that no one of the officers of the King
can, and that no American citizen will, take it upon himself
to receive and take care of the provisions destined
for this purpose. The unjust and arbitrary proceedings,
to which they have been exposed, terrify them, and the
undersigned is obliged to request Congress to leave the
said provisions in their own magazines, and in the hands
of their own officers, till the time of making use of them
arrives. This request has more particular reference to
the flour taken from Wilmington, and which has become
the direct property of Congress by the transfer of it, which
the undersigned made to Congress in one of his latest Memorials.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, July 26th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor
to lay before the Congress of the United States of America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the sequel of the proceedings inserted in the public
papers against M. Holker, Consul of the King, and his
Majesty's general Navy Agent. The first part of these
same proceedings is already in the hands of this august Assembly.
The Minister of France intended merely to lay
the facts before them, and to leave to their wisdom to
determine the measures, that they should judge proper for
putting an end to this offence; but the late unjust, injurious,
and incompetent proceedings, which have been carried
on against a public officer of the King in relation to
the exercise of his functions, the further dangers with which
he is threatened, the indirect consequences, which already
result from them to the representative of his Majesty, and
those which may result more directly from the sentiments
and principles which are manifested, do not permit the
Minister any longer to observe the same moderation.</p>

<p>Congress have received the credentials of the undersigned
Minister in the name of all the United States. They
have accepted, and invested with their authority the other
officers of his Majesty. It consequently belongs to Congress
to protect them against the attacks, which may be
made in their persons on the dignity of his Most Christian
Majesty, and the laws common to all nations governed by
the laws of police, relative to the free exercise of their
functions. Congress is too enlightened to need a comment
upon the insulting writings, which the Minister lays before
them. He merely requests them to take into consideration
the contents of the letter, which the said Minister has
written to the President of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania,
as well as that which the Consul of the King has
addressed to him. Copies of them are annexed. He is
persuaded that Congress will have the less hesitation to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
take this cause in hand, as facts are involved in it relative
to the secret of the alliance, which have happened in
the sight and with the consent of a committee; and as
this reason alone would justify them in taking an exclusive
cognizance of it; besides, the Consul of the King will most
fully prove, if Congress think it necessary, that the orders
he has given have been exactly conformable to the agreement
made with the committee, and to the territorial laws
of the State in which they were executed.</p>

<p>Agreeably to these considerations, the Minister Plenipotentiary
of France has the honor to beg and formally to
request the Congress of the United States of America;</p>

<p>1st. To be pleased to take under their special protection
the Consul of the King, and, if circumstances require
it, his Majesty's other officers.</p>

<p>2dly. To cause the public notice already given to be
repeated, that M. Holker has been accepted by this august
body, and recognised as the Consul of his Most Christian
Majesty.</p>

<p>3dly. To grant to this public officer, or to procure for
him, justice and satisfaction for the attacks publicly made
on his honor and reputation.</p>

<p>4thly. To declare that the Consul of the King has acted
conformably to the views and wishes of Congress, in seeking
to procure provisions for the King's squadron by the
way of trade; that the condition of these private purchases
has always been, that the articles procured should remain
at the free disposal of Congress, either for the army, or
for the benefit of the public, and that not a single barrel of
flour should be exported without their consent and formal
authorisation; that, in consequence of this agreement, the
undersigned Minister has transferred to them the hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
and eightytwo barrels bought at Wilmington, and that this
quantity of provisions has, from this time, become the
property of the United States.</p>

<p>Finally, the undersigned Minister requests Congress to
take the effectual measures that their wisdom shall dictate,
for protecting all the officers of the King, his master,
from every unjust, injurious, and arbitrary proceeding, and
for securing to them the liberty necessary for the exercise
of their functions, without seeing the dignity of his Majesty
and the honor of his officers exposed to farther insults.</p>

<p>The justice of Congress, and their regard for the honor
of a monarch, who is a friend and ally of the United States,
will, doubtless, prevent the serious discussions and the misunderstanding
which such proceedings, if they are not
promptly and authentically made amends for, would undoubtedly
occasion. It is with the most entire confidence,
that the undersigned Minister places this whole affair in
the hands of Congress.</p>

<h3>M. GERARD TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF
PENNSYLVANIA.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, July 26th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>M. Holker, Navy Agent and Consul of the King, my
master, has presented to me his defence in relation to the
suspicions, which some have been pleased to excite as to
his conduct concerning the subsistence of the French fleet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
I approve and confirm all the contents of his letter, and I
declare, that he has acted on this occasion in his capacity
of a public man and an officer of his Most Christian Majesty,
and that all the orders that he has given for the said
subsistence have been given under my direction, and with
the consent and agreeably to the desire of the committee
of the general Congress of the United States.</p>

<p>I hope that the defence of the Consul of the King will
satisfy your Excellency and the Executive Council of this
Province, as well as every honest and unprejudiced man.
At any rate, M. Holker and all the other consuls and
officers of his Most Christian Majesty scattered throughout
America, will always be ready, when they shall be properly
requested, to answer as to anything that shall relate
to the law of the country. It is the serious will of his Majesty;
his representatives are ordered to see to it; and it
is for this reason, that the offers of M. Holker have anticipated
your wishes in this respect. But, Sir, in paying
this just tribute to the sovereignty and to the territorial
law, I must have the honor of observing to you, that there
is no civilized nation where the agents and public servants
of a foreign sovereign do not enjoy immunities and exemptions,
which by the unanimous consent of these nations
have been regarded as indispensably necessary for the free
exercise of their functions; even when they act contrary
to the law of the country, care is taken, and caution used,
in order not to wound the dignity of their constituents, and
not lightly to injure the public character of their officers.
If they have acted only in their official capacity, people
have neither the right nor the power to set themselves up
for judges; but if there are evident proofs, they are transmitted
to the superior officer, if there is one in the country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and it may be to the sovereign himself, and it is for him to
cause satisfaction to be made, or the proper punishments to
be inflicted.</p>

<p>These officers, moreover, cannot be subjected to any
inspection or inquisition with regard to the execution of
their public functions, except to that of their own sovereign
and his representatives; it does not belong to any one
whatsoever to assume in this respect a power and an authority,
which would become an attack on the rights of the
sovereign of another country, and an injury to its representatives.
This would be a violation of the laws common to
nations governed by the laws of police, and a manifest infraction
of the principles upon which the mutual and necessary
communication between friendly nations is founded,
and without which the appointment and the residence of
the respective public officers would become dangerous and
impossible, if in any country whatever these principles
were not acknowledged, or if any person pretended, without
the consent of a sovereign, to set up for a guardian
of his officers, and to censure and condemn their conduct
in his name, or under the pretext of his interest. If
this usurped power extended even to actions, the scene of
which was without the territory of the State; if it were
allowable to take the property of a sovereign by force from
the place of deposit, notwithstanding the protest of the
civil magistrate, and in a foreign State, to which alone
it would belong to protest against the violence of its laws;
in fine, if after assuming the pretext of taking care of his
interests, any one should dare to sentence explicitly or by
implication a foreign King to pay a penalty or fines, and if
the public officers were represented as enemies of the
country, even while they were employed in affairs of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
utmost secrecy and of the greatest importance for this very
country's own interest, they would then be deprived of the
liberty, which every citizen and every other stranger enjoys;
while, on the other hand, the terrified citizens would
refuse to take part in any affair relating to this power, in
order to preserve their reputation and tranquillity. These
officers would then be prevented from fulfilling their duties
to their master, particularly if the crime of falsehood were
publicly imputed to them while their title and quality were
called in question, although publicly and authentically acknowledged
by all the powers of the country. Such conduct
would be a marked insult, and this situation very near
to a state of hostilities would tend to destroy all confidence,
all commerce, and all correspondence between the
two friendly and allied nations; and there would remain
only one course to be pursued by the representatives of
that which should be injured, and which could not obtain
immediate satisfaction; namely, that of seeking an asylum
in a country where the respect which a nation owes to an
independent, friendly, and allied power, as well as to its
representatives, is known, and where, by conforming to
the territorial laws, one can rely upon the effectual protection
of the sovereign, against every injurious, violent, and
arbitrary proceeding.</p>

<p>My duty, Sir, places me under the necessity of offering
these remarks to your Excellency and the Executive
Council. Having no direct credentials for the Republic
of Pennsylvania, I cannot demand reparations from it as a
Minister, and I can only address myself to the Congress of
the United States, forasmuch as the facts in question have
all happened under its sanction and by its authorisation;
but my desire to preserve the decency, harmony, and good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
understanding, which ought to prevail between two allied
States, will justify me in earnestly requesting your Excellency
and the Executive Council to take immediately into
consideration the preceding observations, and without delay
to communicate to me your opinion on this subject. An
explicit and positive answer is indispensable in this delicate
and critical juncture, in order that I may take the
measures suitable to the dignity of the King, my master, as
well as to the tranquillity and to the honor of his officers of
all ranks and denominations, and at all events to enable his
Majesty to provide himself for the maintenance of his
dignity. Meanwhile I give orders to suspend every proceeding
susceptible of new inconveniences, and every operation
in the State of Pennsylvania on account of his Most
Christian Majesty on the part of his officers, until the rules
to which they are to conform shall be known and fixed,
and till the public is convinced that the citizens do not
expose their honor and their tranquillity, when they treat
with the officers of the King, and when they conform to
the laws of their States.</p>

Philadelphia, July 24th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor of forwarding to your Excellency Mr
Dunlap's publication of this day, in which I find, with
some degree of surprise, a paragraph levelled at me and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
my official transactions. I observe that notwithstanding the
most explicit and repeated offers I made to you yesterday
morning, and through you to the honorable the Supreme
Executive Council of this State, of proving that I had not
in any shape violated or infringed the laws of Pennsylvania,
that I had acted in perfect conformity therewith;
notwithstanding I solemnly declared that the flour seized
was bought and destined for the sole use of his Majesty's
fleet; notwithstanding the many and forcible reasons urged
to your Excellency to convince you that more proper and
more decent measures might have been pursued, and that
the steps I had taken to supply his Majesty's fleet were
not only proper, but were dictated by mere necessity;
notwithstanding all these circumstances, I am still held up
to the public in a suspicious light, and as if I were answerable
or accountable for the private and personal transactions
of Mr Rumford of Wilmington, transactions totally
foreign to me and to the instructions or orders given him
by me.</p>

<p>My application to you, Sir, in this respect, seems to

representation on this subject, which you were pleased to
communicate to me by your letter of this day. I am
sorry to remark, that though I have acted in concert with
his Excellency, our Minister Plenipotentiary, that Congress
has always been apprised of the purchases made by
my orders; though all the provisions purchased and delivered
into the hands of my agents have been at all times
at the disposal of Congress in consequence of express
stipulations; though I have given with pleasure the widest
room for inquiry into the grounds of all suspicions, in order
that a thorough investigation might establish public tranquillity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
and public confidence, which I had the greatest reason
to expect, because it is evident, even by the publications,
that not a single suspicion was founded on solid ground,
but merely on surmise; still his Majesty's representative in
this Commonwealth, his Agent General in all the ports of
the United States, acknowledged as such by Congress, by
yourself, and the board at which you preside, specially
charged, in conjunction with the Minister Plenipotentiary,
with procuring the necessary supplies for his Majesty's
squadron, expressly fitted out for the defence of these
States against the common enemy, and for the protection
of his dominions in America, acting in the strict line of his
office and duty, is most wantonly traduced to the public,
branded with the most injurious and unfair imputations in
the newspapers published in this very city, where these
facts and my public character are most notorious, under
your eyes, with your knowledge, and in contradiction to
your personal advice and disapprobation.</p>

<p>I need not expatiate on the evil consequences, that may
arise from such illiberal aggression. I need not claim
your interposition. But the reasons I gave you yesterday,
becoming every instant more forcible and more pressing,
it is necessary that I demand the most immediate exertions
of government on this occasion.</p>

<p>It is with the utmost reluctance I sit down to appeal in
this solemn manner to the Executive power of Pennsylvania
for justice, lest my request may be construed an
opposition to the respectable motives of the informers on
my conduct; but I am accountable to my royal master for
my actions, and obliged to exact that respect due to his
representative in this State, and to support the dignity of
the character with which he has been pleased to invest me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Therefore, it is in compliance with my duty, that I submit
these facts and the repeated insults I meet with, to the
reflections of your Excellency and Council, relying fully
on your sense of propriety, and on your exertions on this
occasion, as in all others, where I have applied for
redress.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>After the visit you favored me with yesterday, and in
consideration of the point on which we conversed, I wrote
the letter enclosed, and about six o'clock the answer, also

two of the committee, that I had seen you that morning,
that you conceived yourself able to remove the imputations
conveyed in their representations, and had requested the
Council to point out the parts of your conduct, on which
doubts might arise. The gentlemen promised me they
would inform the other gentlemen of what I had represented;
and also that I still thought there would be an impropriety
in making the publication in the present circumstances.
I observe this morning, that the gentlemen have
been of a different opinion, doubtless deeming themselves

<h3>JOSEPH REED TO WILLIAM HENRY, CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Walnut Street, July 23d, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I received this morning the report of the committee on
the affairs of M. Holker, which by a particular accident I
was prevented from laying before the Council this morning.
I observe it is proposed to publish it, but I presume this
does not mean an immediate publication, as there will be
an indelicacy and violation of usual forms to do this, until
a return has been officially made thereupon by us to Congress,
through whom the matter came to us. In all cases
of petitions or other papers, to be presented to any public
body, I take it to be a standing rule, that the matter shall
be first communicated to them, before it is published to
the world. As I observe you have sent a copy to M.
Holker, I presume it is intended thereby to give him an
opportunity to explain, deny, or admit, such a part of it as
he may think proper to do. A publication will in some
measure debar him from this, whereas at a future day, if
the publication is still thought necessary, the whole may be
given together; at all events, it will be the duty of the
Council to make some report to Congress, in which this
narration will appear. As to the flour itself, perhaps there
may be no inconvenience in letting it remain a few days
in its present condition. My earnest wish is, that this business
may be conducted without fear, favor, or partiality,
to the real interests of the community, all first suspicions
converted into solid proof, and those of a contrary kind
effectually banished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>The good sense of the gentlemen to whom I address
myself will, I am persuaded, make the necessary and present
distinction between persons acting in a public capacity
and character, especially of another nation, and our own
citizens, who are to stand or fall by their own laws, and
the estimation of their countrymen.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM HENRY TO JOSEPH REED.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Friday Afternoon, 5 o'clock, Committee Room.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We had the honor of your favor of this morning, and
beg leave to observe in answer thereto, that Mr Morris
having already published an account of the flour, both in
behalf of himself and M. Holker, as may be judged by his
publishing M. Holker's letters, and that publication being
prior to any report from the Council to Congress, we
conceive there can be no impropriety in our now taking the
matter publicly up. Besides which, we apprehend ourselves
laid under an immediate necessity to give satisfaction
to our fellow citizens on the subject, and to publish
our proceedings for the previous consideration of the meeting
on Monday.</p>

<p>M. Holker, we conceive, ought in justice to himself to
have appealed to the Council agreeably to the resolution
of Congress, which he has not done. We have deferred
the matter to the last moment, and cannot now, without
exposing the reputation of the committee, defer it longer.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is sensible that nothing but the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
pressing necessity could induce us to depart from the
advice you are pleased to give, and we request you to
accept the reasons we have assigned as an apology for so
doing.</p>

<p>By order of the committee.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your Excellency's most obedient,
humble servant,</p>

<p class="signed">WILLIAM HENRY, <i>Chairman</i>.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<p>All the above memorials, letters, and papers received
from the Minister this day, were referred to a committee
of five, namely, Mr Huntington, Mr Laurens, Mr Smith,
Mr Morris, and Mr Kean, who were instructed to confer
with the President and the Supreme Executive Council of
the State of Pennsylvania and with the Minister and Consul
of France, and to prepare and report a state of facts,
together with their opinion of the measures proper for
Congress to adopt thereupon.</p>

which have been sent to me by Mr Rumford of
Wilmington. As these papers have a direct relation to
the conduct of Mr Rumford, and to the seizure made of

duplicates of them to the Council of the State of Pennsylvania.
I hope that there will be found in them proofs of
the desire, which has always animated me to conform in
everything to the resolutions or recommendations of Congress,
as well as to dispel all the doubts or suspicions
which insinuations, assertions, or publications could have
shed upon me. I dare even flatter myself, that I shall at

<h3>THE PRESIDENT OF PENNSYLVANIA TO M. GERARD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Council, Philadelphia, July 31st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have now the honor of addressing you in answer to the
representation you were pleased to make to this Board on
the 24th instant. When, to every principle of public affection,
policy, and justice, there is added our experience of
your personal friendship to America, and your attachment
and engaging deportment to the citizens of Pennsylvania of
every rank, all professions on our part to make your residence
in the State happy, easy, and honorable, must be
unnecessary. It is not easy, therefore, for us to find language
to express our concern at any transaction which
may disturb your repose, and interrupt the exercise of
those functions discharged with so much honor to yourself
and satisfaction to those, who are called to take any part in
public affairs.</p>

<p>In some communications which the Honorable Congress
have been pleased to make to us, we also see, with great
concern, that apprehensions are expressed, the reality of
which we should deplore as an evil of the first magnitude.
Be assured, Sir, that the citizens of Philadelphia, and of
Pennsylvania, cannot entertain sentiments so unworthy; but
if there are any so lost to every sense of propriety, decency,
and order, the authority of the State has power equal to
its inclination to check and suppress so licentious and
wicked a procedure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>We entreat you, therefore, to dismiss every idea so
painful and so dishonorable to us as that of personal insult,
and repose confidence in us when we confirm to you our
assurances of the affection, respect, and esteem of our
constituents. And if there are any persons, who presume
to insinuate dangers of outrages, as suggested in your representations,
we most earnestly request you to consider them
either as ignorant of the real sentiments of those of whom
they speak, or as acting from less honorable motives.</p>

<p>I have now the honor of acquainting you, that upon the
requisition of this Board, the flour in question, and which
has given rise to this unhappy discussion, is delivered up
to this Board, and that it is ready to be put into the disposal
of M. Holker, or any person he may direct, for the
purposes of its original destination, without any condition
or restriction, a measure, which we hope both as to you
and himself, will be considered as a relinquishment of
those terms, which form a ground of your complaint.
Our desire to make the most early and explicit avowal of
our sentiments and intentions has induced us to make this
communication, at the same time all other business being
laid aside, we are considering the papers which touch the
character of M. Holker, upon which we shall, without
delay, address ourselves to the Honorable Congress of the
United States, through whom those communications have
been made to us, and we trust it will fully appear, that a
veneration for the Prince, whose servant he is, respect to
your interposition, justice to him, and a due regard to the
rights and interests of this State, have influenced our determination.</p>

<p>We observe all the papers respecting this transaction
have been transmitted to you, except a resolution of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France is eager to
thank Congress for the readiness with which they have
been pleased to yield to his representations of the 26th of
last month.</p>

<p>The resolutions, which have been communicated to the
undersigned in the name of Congress, appear to him to
leave nothing to be desired; he only hopes that the public
will be informed of the opinions of Congress, in whatever
form they shall think the most suitable; and the Minister
Plenipotentiary is persuaded, that his Court will regard
the said resolutions as a suitable and sufficient satisfaction
for the proceedings which they condemn, and the offence
which has resulted from them.</p>

<p>It is under this impression, that the undersigned Minister
takes the liberty to request Congress not to carry into execution
that one of their resolutions which orders, that those
who on this occasion may have violated the laws of nations
shall be prosecuted. The King's greatness of mind
forbids his Minister to insist upon such a measure. Between
nations closely connected by the most powerful
motives of friendship and interest, even the most lawful
reparations ought always to stop short of revenge. It is
sufficient to undeceive the public, and to restrain the evil-disposed
men, who sometimes conceal themselves under
the pretence of the common good. The said Minister,
consequently, earnestly requests Congress to stop the said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
prosecutions, and he dares hope this from the moderation
of Congress, provided that motives foreign to France
and independent of the present affair do not cause this
august body, or the Executive Council of Pennsylvania, to
see in this indulgence inconveniences, which are out of the
sphere of the undersigned Minister.</p>

you must be sensible, that nothing but the most urgent

<p><i>In Congress, September 7th.</i> The President laid
before Congress a paper of intelligence, which he received
from the Minister Plenipotentiary of France,
and which is as follows, being an extract of a letter
from Count de Vergennes to M. Gerard, dated Versailles,
June 29th, 1779.</p>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_open">"Sir,</p>

<p>"The decision of Spain is public. Her Ambassador
quitted London on the 18th of this month; he is now
at Paris. Her forces are on their march to join with
ours. The junction made, they will endeavor to inflict
on England a blow sufficiently heavy to force her
to acknowledge the independence of America. To
free herself if possible from this hard necessity, and
to procure herself the power of opposing at some
future time a nation, which she will not without great
reluctance consent to free from the servitude, which
she wished to impose upon them, it seems that she
has sent two emissaries to Congress with the offer of a
truce, and even with power to withdraw all the English
forces, if America will determine to give up our
alliance, and to separate herself from us.</p>

<p>"I do not imagine that this treachery can even enter
into the mind of Congress, but if they should be enticed
by the love of peace, a single reflection ought
to stop it. As soon as England shall have proved the
defection, she can settle her affairs with us, and we
shall have no reason to refuse to do it; she will then
fall upon America with the whole mass of her power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
very certain that no nation in Europe will afterwards
take any interest in a nation, which shall have signalized
its birth by the most unworthy cowardice of
which a government can be guilty. I am persuaded,
Sir, that this reflection seasonably presented, will be
of great effect. There are many other reflections,
which certainly will not escape your wisdom."</p>

"Gentlemen,</p>

<p>"The King, my master, having been pleased to accept
the representations, which my bad state of health compelled
me to make to him, has permitted me to return.
At the same time he has been in haste to send another
Minister Plenipotentiary to America, in order that there
may be no interruption in the care of cultivating the mutual
friendship. I must leave it to the talents of the
Chevalier de la Luzerne to explain to you his Majesty's
sentiments, and will confine myself here, Gentlemen, to
expressing to you the satisfaction I shall experience in
giving an account to him of the events, of which I have
been a witness during more than a year's residence with
you. He will perceive in them the sentiments, which animate
and direct your counsels, your wisdom, your firmness,
your attachment to the alliance, and your zeal for the
prosperity of the common cause and of the two respective

nations. He will see, with pleasure, the valuable union,
which constitutes the principal force and power of confederated
America, that not only the citizens are in no want
of zeal or vigor to repel the incursions, which henceforth
can have no other object than a barbarous devastation, but
also that there is no American, who does not perceive the
necessity of uniting to humble the common enemy more
and more, and to weaken him by efforts proportionate to
the importance of putting a happy end to a glorious revolution,
and also of securing to confederated America, by a
firm and honorable peace, as quickly as possible, the inestimable
advantages of liberty and independence, which
form the essential and fundamental object of the alliance,
and of the war provoked and made necessary by England.</p>

<p>"It remains to me, Gentlemen, to offer you in general
and individually, the tribute of my gratitude for the marks
of confidence and esteem, and for the attentions which I
have received from you. I have always endeavored to
deserve them by the most sincere and lively attachment to
the interests and to the dignity of the United States, as
well as to the principles and sentiments resulting from the
alliance. I have not lacked zeal for everything that might
relate to them, and cement more and more the connexions,
whether political or personal, between the two nations.
The most flattering recompense of my labors would be the
expression of your satisfaction.</p>

was founded, the advantages derived from it, and the
blessings it promises to both nations; that their resolution
of securing its essential objects, liberty and independence,

we cannot contemplate without pain and regret. Nevertheless,
as they demonstrate the anxieties of a faithful

<p>Caesar Anne de la Luzerne succeeded M. Gerard
as Minister Plenipotentiary from France to the United
States. He had previously been employed in a diplomatic
capacity, and with much success, in Bavaria, which
he left in July, 1778. He was soon after appointed to
supply the place of M. Gerard, and arrived in Philadelphia
on the 21st of September, 1779. As his predecessor
was still discharging the functions of his office, the Chevalier
de la Luzerne did not receive his first audience of
Congress till the 17th of November.</p>

<p>From that time to the end of the war he applied himself
sedulously to the duties of his station, and by the suavity
of his manners, as well as by the uniform discretion of
his official conduct, he won the esteem and confidence of
the American people. His efforts were all directed to the
support of the alliance, on the principles of equity, and the
broad basis of reciprocal interests established in the treaties.</p>

<p>After remaining in the United States more than five
years, he obtained permission to visit France, although he
did not then resign his commission as Minister. A few
months afterwards, however, he wrote to Mr Jay, then
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, that, being designed by the
King for another appointment, his character as Plenipotentiary
to the United States had ceased. M. Barbé
Marbois, who had been the Secretary of Legation during
the whole of M. de la Luzerne's residence in America,
succeeded him as <i>Chargé d'Affaires</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>The Chevalier de la Luzerne accepted the appointment

<h3>
SUBSTANCE OF A CONFERENCE BETWEEN M. DE LA
LUZERNE AND GENERAL WASHINGTON AT HEAD QUARTERS,
WEST POINT.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
September 16th, 1779.</p>

<p>The Minister opened the conference by observing, that
the Council of Massachusetts had represented to him the
disadvantages, which their commerce was likely to suffer
from the late misfortune in Penobscot, and the advantages
which would result if his Excellency, Count d'Estaing,
could detach a few ships of the line and frigates to be stationed
upon their coast for protecting their commerce, and
countenancing the operations of their cruisers against that
of the enemy. But before he should propose such a
measure to Count d'Estaing, he wished to know from the
General, what purposes the detachment would answer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
his military operations, and whether it would enable him to
prosecute any offensive enterprise against the enemy.
That if he could accompany the request of the Council
with assurance of this kind, a motive of such importance
would have the greatest influence in determining the
concurrence of Count d'Estaing, and might the better
justify him in deranging or contracting his plans in the
West Indies, by making a detachment of his force.</p>

<p>The General answered, that if Count d'Estaing could
spare a detachment superior to the enemy's naval force
upon this continent, retaining such a force in the West
Indies, as would put it out of the enemy's power to detach
an equal force to this continent without leaving themselves
inferior in the Islands, the measure would have a high
probability of many important and perhaps decisive advantages;
but these would depend upon several contingencies;
as the time in which the detachment can arrive, and
the position and force of the enemy when it arrives. That
the season proper for military operations was now pretty
far advanced, and to make a winter campaign would require
a disposition of our magazines peculiar to it, which
could not be made without a large increase of expense, a
circumstance not to be desired in the present posture of
our affairs, unless the arrival of a naval succor was an
event of some certainty. That with respect to the position
and force of the enemy, they had now about fourteen
thousand men at New York and its dependencies, and between
three and four thousand at Rhode Island; that to
reduce the former, if it should be concentered on the
Island, would require extensive preparations beforehand,
both as to magazines and aids of men, which could not
with propriety be undertaken on a precarious expectation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
of assistance. But that if the garrison of Rhode Island
should continue there, we should have every reason to
expect its reduction by a combined operation; it might,
however, be withdrawn; he added, that the enemy appear
to be making large detachments from New York,
which the present situation of their affairs seems to exact;
that there is a high probability of their being left so weak
as to give us an opportunity, during the winter, of acting
effectually against New York, in case of the arrival of a
fleet to co-operate with us, even with the force we now
have and could suddenly assemble on an emergency; that,
at all events, the French squadron would be able to strike
an important stroke, in the capture and destruction of the
enemy's vessels of war, with a large number of transports
and perhaps seamen.</p>

<p>He concluded with observing, that though in the great
uncertainty of the arrival of a squadron, he could not undertake
to make expensive preparations for co-operating,
nor pledge himself for doing it effectually, yet there was
the greatest prospect of utility from the arrival of such a
squadron, and he would engage to do everything in his
power for improving its aid, if it should appear upon our
coast; that if the present or future circumstances should
permit Count d'Estaing to concert a combined operation
with the troops of these States against the enemy's fleets
and armies within these States, he would be ready to promote
the measure to the utmost of our resources, and
should have the highest hopes of its success; it would,
however, be necessary, to prevent delay and give efficacy
to the project, that he should have some previous notice.</p>

<p>The Minister replied, that the General's delicacy upon
the occasion was very proper, but as he seemed unwilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
to give assurances of effectual co-operation, in conveying
the application to the Admiral he would only make use of
the name of the Council, which would, no doubt, have all
the weight due to the application of so respectable a body.</p>

<p>The General assented, observing, that occasional mention
might be made of the military advantages to be expected
from the measure.</p>

<p>The Minister next informed the General, that there had
been some negotiations between Congress and M. Gerard,
on the subject of the Floridas and the limits of the Spanish
dominions in that quarter, concerning which, certain resolutions
had been taken by Congress, which he supposed
were known to the General. He added, that the Spaniards
had in contemplation an expedition against the Floridas,
which was either already begun or very soon would
be begun, and he wished to know the General's opinion of
a co-operation on our part; that it was probable this expedition
would immediately divert the enemy's force from
South Carolina and Georgia, and the question then would
be, whether General Lincoln's army would be necessary
elsewhere, or might be employed in a co-operation with
the Spanish forces. That the motive with the French
Court for wishing such a co-operation was, that it would
be a meritorious act on the side of the United States
towards Spain, who, though she had all along been well
disposed to the revolution, had entered reluctantly into the
war and had not yet acknowledged our independence;
that a step of this kind would serve to confirm her good
dispositions, and to induce her not only to enter into a
treaty with us, but, perhaps, to assist with a loan of money.
That the forces of Spain in the Islands were so considerable,
as would in all appearance make our aid unnecessary;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
on which account the utility of it, only contingent and possible,
was but a secondary consideration with the Court of
France; the desire to engage Spain more firmly in our
interests, by a mark of our good will to her, was the leading
and principal one.</p>

<p>The General assured the Minister, that he had the
deepest sense of the friendship of France, but replied to
the matter in question, that he was altogether a stranger to
the measures adopted by Congress relative to the Floridas,
and could give no opinion of the propriety of the co-operation
proposed in a civil or political light; but considering
it merely as a military question, he saw no objection to the
measure, on the supposition that the enemy's force in
Georgia and South Carolina be withdrawn, without which
it would, of course, be impossible.</p>

<p>The Minister then asked, in case the operation by the
Spaniards against the Floridas should not induce the English
to abandon the Southern States, whether it would be
agreeable that the forces, either French or Spanish, employed
there, should co-operate with our troops against
those of the enemy in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>

<p>The General replied, that he imagined such a co-operation
would be desirable.</p>

<p>The Minister inquired in the next place, whether in
case the Court of France should find it convenient to send
directly from France a squadron and a few regiments attached
to it, to act in conjunction with us in this quarter,
it would be agreeable to the United States.</p>

<p>The General thought it would contribute much to advance
the common cause.</p>

<p>The Minister informed us, that Dr Franklin had purchased
a fifty gun ship, which the King of France intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
to equip for the benefit of the United States, to be sent with
two or three frigates to Newfoundland to act against the
enemy's vessels employed in the fishery, and afterwards to
proceed to Boston to cruise from that port.</p>

<p>He concluded the conference with stating, that in Boston
several gentlemen of influence, some of them members
of Congress, had conversed with him on the subject of an
expedition against Canada and Nova Scotia; that his
Christian Majesty had a sincere and disinterested desire to
see those two Provinces annexed to the American Confederacy,
and would be disposed to promote a plan for
this purpose; but that he would undertake nothing of the
kind unless the plan was previously approved and digested
by the General. He added, that a letter from the General
to Congress some time since, on the subject of an expedition
to Canada, had appeared in France, and had been
submitted to the best military judges, who approved the
reasoning, and thought the objections to the plan, which
had been proposed, very plausible and powerful. That
whenever the General should think the circumstances of
this country favorable to such an undertaking, he should
be very glad to recommend the plan he should propose,
and he was assured that the French Court would give it
all the aid in their power.</p>

<p>The General again expressed his sense of the good dispositions
of his Christian Majesty, but observed, that while
the enemy remain in force in these States, the difficulties
stated in his letter alluded to by the Minister would still
subsist; but that whenever that force should be removed,
he doubted not it would be a leading object with the government
to wrest the two aforementioned Provinces from
the power of Britain; that in this case, he should esteem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
himself honored in being consulted on the plan; and was
of opinion, that though we should have land force enough
for the undertaking, without in this respect intruding upon
the generosity of our allies, a naval co-operation would
certainly be very useful and necessary.</p>

<p>The rest of the conference consisted in mutual assurances
of friendship of the two countries, &amp;c. interspersed
on the General's side with occasional remarks on the importance
of removing the war from these States, as it
would enable us to afford ample supplies to the operations
in the West Indies, and to act with efficacy in annoying
the commerce of the enemy, and dispossessing them of
their dominions on this continent.</p>

he shall say to you on our behalf, especially when he shall
assure you of the sincerity of our wishes for your prosperity,
as well as the constancy of our affection and our
friendship for the United States in general, and for each
one of them in particular. We pray God to keep you,
our very dear great friends and allies, in his holy protection.</p>

<p class="indent1">"Your good friend and ally,</p>

<p class="signed">LOUIS."</p>

<p>The Minister being announced, he addressed Congress
in the following speech.</p>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
"Gentlemen,</p>

<p>"The wisdom and courage, which have founded your
Republic, the prudence which presides over your deliberations,
your firmness in execution, the skill and valor displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
by your Generals and soldiers during the course of
the war, have attracted the admiration and regard of the
whole world.</p>

<p>"The King, my master, was the first to acknowledge a
liberty acquired amidst so many perils and with so much
glory. Since treaties dictated by moderation have fixed
upon a permanent basis the union of France with the
American Republic, his Majesty's whole conduct must
have demonstrated how dearly he cherishes your prosperity,
and his firm resolution to maintain your independence
by every means in his power. The events,
which have successively unfolded themselves, show the
wisdom of those measures. A powerful ally has acknowledged
the justice of those motives, which had compelled
the King to take arms, and we may reasonably hope for
the most solid success from the operations of the united
fleets. The naval force of the enemy has been diverted
from your continent, compelled to flee to the defence of
their own possessions. All their efforts have been too
feeble to prevent our troops from conquering a considerable
part. Other British Islands feared the same lot,
when the French General stopped the current of his success
to seek new dangers here. In conforming to his
Majesty's intentions, he has acceded to his own inclinations,
to the desires of the French, and to the request of
the Americans, who invited him to join his arms to those
of your Republic. Events have not completely answered
his courage and his efforts, but his blood and that of my
countrymen, shed in a cause so dear to us, has cemented
the basis on which the alliance is founded, and impressed
on it a character as indelible as are all those by which it is
already consecrated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p>"That alliance, Gentlemen, becomes daily more indissoluble,
and the benefits, which the two nations derive
from it, have given it the most perfect consistency.</p>

<p>"The relations of commerce between the subjects of the
King, my master, and the inhabitants of the Thirteen
United States, continually multiply, and we may already
perceive, in spite of those obstacles, which embarrass the
reciprocal communication, how natural it is, how advantageous
it will be to the two nations, and all who participate
in it, and how much the monopolising spirit, the
jealous attention and prohibitory edicts of the enemy to
your freedom, have been prejudicial to your happiness.
It is under these circumstances, Gentlemen, that the King
has been pleased to appoint me his Minister Plenipotentiary
to your Republic. You have seen in the letter,
which I had just now the honor to deliver from him, fresh
assurances of his friendship. I consider as the happiest
circumstance of my life a mission, in the course of which I
am certain of fulfilling my duty, when I labor for your
prosperity, and I felicitate myself upon being sent to a
nation, whose interests are so intimately blended with our
own, that I can be useful neither to France nor the American
Republic, without rendering myself agreeable both to
the one and the other.</p>

<p>"It was certainly desirable that the affairs with which I
am charged had remained in the hands of that enlightened
Minister, whom I succeed, and whose health compels him
to return to France. I have not his abilities; but like him,
I have an unbounded zeal for the welfare and success of
the common cause. Like him, I am directed to concur
in everything, which can be useful or agreeable to your
Republic. I have the same attachment to the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
whom you, Gentlemen, represent, and the same admiration
of their conduct. I have the most fervent wish to give
you the proof of it; and I hope by these different titles to
merit your confidence and your esteem.</p>

<p class="signed">LUZERNE."</p>

<p>The translation of the foregoing speech being read to
the House by the Secretary of Congress, the President
returned the following answer.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
"Sir,</p>

<p>"The early attention of our good friend and ally to
these United States is gratefully felt by all their virtuous
citizens, and we should be unfaithful representatives if we
did not warmly acknowledge every instance of his regard,
and take every opportunity of expressing the attachment of
our constituents to treaties formed upon the purest principles.</p>

<p>"His Most Christian Majesty, in rendering himself a
protector of the rights of mankind, became entitled to assistance
from the friends of man. This title could not but
be recognised by a monarch, whose diadem is adorned
with equity and truth. That monarch, by joining his arms
to those of our great ally, has given a fatal blow to the
common enemy, and from the justice of the motives which
unite the combined fleets, we expect the most solid benefits
will crown their operations. Nor can we doubt that other
powers will rejoice to see that haughty nation humbled, in
proportion as they have been insulted by her presumptuous
arrogance. We well know, and all the world must acknowledge,
the moderation and friendship of the Most
Christian King, in neglecting conquests which courted his
acceptance, for the benevolent pleasure of succoring his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
allies. In this, as in every other instance, we perceive his
strict adherence to the principles of our defensive alliance.
We are sensible of the zeal of the French General in executing
his Majesty's orders. We esteem his courage, we
lament his wounds, and we respect that generous valor,
which has led your countrymen to contend with ours in
the same common cause in the same field of glory; a
noble emulation, which has poured out the blood of the
two nations and mingled it together as a sacred pledge of
perpetual union.</p>

<p>"The consequences, which have followed from the appearance
of the French fleet upon our coasts, particularly
by disconcerting the enemy's plans of operations, and destroying
a considerable part of their naval force, demonstrate
the wisdom of the measure. That they have not
been still more beneficial is to be attributed to those incidents,
which in the hand of Providence determine all
human events. But our disappointment is compensated
by reflecting on the perfect harmony, that subsisted between
the Generals and the troops of the two nations.</p>

<p>"The prosperous course of this campaign gives a pleasing
hope that the moment of peace may soon arrive, when
the reciprocation of mutual good offices shall amply recompence
our mutual labors and cares, and we doubt not but
in that moment the commerce between the allied nations,
now struggling under great inconveniences, will shoot forth
with vigor and advantage, and happily demonstrate the injuries
we once suffered from the restraints of our enemies.</p>

<p>"While we lament, Sir, the loss of your worthy predecessor,
we are led from your personal character to the
pleasing expectation, that you will possess that confidence
and esteem which he enjoyed. They are due to the servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
of our benefactor; we are happy in his choice, and
being thoroughly convinced of the intimate connexion
between the interests and views of the allied nations, we
cannot but persuade ourselves, that the more attentively
you shall perform your duty to your Sovereign, and the
more sedulously you shall guard and promote the welfare
of your country, the more agreeable and respectable you
will render yourself to the citizens of America.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h3>DON JUAN MIRALLES TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, November 25th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the honor of communicating to you on the 22d
instant two letters, which I received from the Governor-General
of the Island of Cuba, dated the 13th and the 22d
of July last. He informs me by order of the King, my
master, that the declaration of war against the King of
Great Britain, made by his Majesty, was solemnly published
at Havana, on the 22d of the said month of July, and he
requests me to ask for the co-operation of the United
States of America in the measures, the substance of which
I am now to have the honor of recalling to your recollection.</p>

<p>The Honorable Congress having formerly proposed to
lay siege to the town of St Augustine in East Florida, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
order to restore it, in case of success, to the troops of his
Catholic Majesty, I am ordered to urge the said Congress
to direct the arms of the United States against that place,
in the hope that this diversion will give powerful assistance
to those, which the forces of the King have made by their
attack on Pensacola; and that consequently, the English
troops may be more readily driven from the territory of
the American Republics. I am to inform the Governor-General
of Havana, at what time the Honorable Congress
will be able to undertake this conquest, as well as what
land and naval forces that body will be able to employ in
effecting it; in order that the Spanish Generals may
arrange their operations agreeably to the information,
which I shall transmit to them.</p>

<p>I am also ordered to invite the Honorable Congress to
undertake the conquest of the territory and the possessions
held by the English to the northeast of Louisiana; and as
the Governor of that province may by his experience contribute
greatly to the success of such an enterprise, he is
desirous of knowing the plan of operations, which Congress
will adopt in this affair, in order that on his part he may
second it by every effort in his power.</p>

<p>The Governor-General of Havana is desirous of knowing
the quantity and kind of provisions, productions, and
supplies, with which the United States of America will be
able to assist Havana, and the Island of Cuba, as well as
the other possessions of his Majesty in America, in order
that he may decide according to such information, upon
the measures to be adopted for procuring his supplies of
provisions.</p>

<p>I had yesterday the honor of communicating these various
requests to the Honorable Congress, which body was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
pleased to appoint three of its members to confer with me
upon them. They declared, Sir, that they should be
much gratified to see my proposals supported by you; and
I entreat you to be pleased by your intervention to give
all requisite weight to the importance of these great objects.</p>

<p>The sending as soon as possible, of such forces and
stores as Congress shall think proper, is of the greatest
consequence. Of equal importance are the means of
securing their arrival at their place of destination, with all
the security which circumstances will allow. It is then
desirable, Sir, that you would have the kindness to persuade
the Count de Grasse to be pleased to take them on
board of his squadron, and to conduct them under his convoy
to South Carolina or Georgia; and the deputies of
Congress have desired me to make this request of you. I
have answered them, in consequence of the communications,
which you have been pleased to make to me, that
you had already made some overtures to that commander,
in relation to the operations in which he might engage,
and that you were now expecting his answer.</p>

<p>The interests of our Sovereigns, Sir, are so closely connected,
the independence and welfare of United America
are objects so dear and so important to you, that I have
no doubt you will use all efforts to secure a compliance
with the requests, which I have the honor to make
of you in the name of the King, my master, and on the
success of which depends, in a great degree, the success
of the general operations of the allied powers.</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor
of communicating to the Congress of the United States,
a letter of Don Juan de Miralles, containing sundry propositions,
which appear to him to deserve the most serious
attention. Although the Chevalier de la Luzerne has no
instructions from his Catholic Majesty, he is too sensible
of the good understanding and intimate connexion subsisting
between the Courts of Versailles and Madrid, not to
recommend these overtures in the most pressing manner to
the consideration of Congress.</p>

<p>The great design is to act against the common enemy,
and the more pains that are taken to unite the strokes
aimed against them, the more certain will be their effects.
As to what regards the concurrence of the royal fleet in
the operations proposed, the underwritten has the honor
to observe, that he is entirely uninformed touching the part
it will be able to take. He has, however, written a letter
to the Count de Grasse, which that commander will receive
on his arrival at Hampton. As soon as the underwritten
shall have received an answer, and the necessary
information, he will take the earliest opportunity of communicating
them to such of the delegates as Congress shall

Philadelphia, December 6th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary of France has
the honor of informing Congress, that he has received
from St Domingo intelligence of the capture of the Greyhound,
by eight American sailors. He annexes a summary
of some facts relative to this capture.</p>

<p>In the terms of the intelligence, given on the 4th of
August, of the present year, by the officers of the Admiralty
of Port Paix, "the eight American sailors, having
taken the said schooner, without being provided with any
commission, have been sent back before Congress, in order
that this affair may be decided in conformity with the laws
of their country."</p>

<p>The undersigned Minister is then desirous, that Congress
would be pleased to inform him, what use they shall
judge proper to make of the thirteen thousand nine hundred
and eighty nine livres, ten sols, which remain in the registry
of the Admiralty of Port Paix; whether it be thought
proper that this sum should be remitted to the agent of
Congress at St Domingo, in order that he may transmit it
to the eight men interested, in such manner as he shall
think fit, or whether Congress shall adopt an entirely different
mode of proceeding. The Chevalier de la Luzerne
will hasten to communicate to the commandants of the
Island of St Domingo, whatever resolution may have been
adopted, in order that they may without delay make
arrangements accordingly. The undersigned would have
wished to spare Congress the detail of this affair, by addressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
himself directly to the States of Massachusetts and
Rhode Island, in order to ascertain their intentions, but
the intelligence upon which the order of the General
and Intendant of St Domingo has intervened, obliges the
parties to come before Congress; besides, this form is the
best adapted to prevent all delays, and to cause this money
to arrive promptly at the destination, which shall be determined
upon.</p>

<h3>PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, December 16th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I am directed to inform you, that Congress in order to
testify their attention to the interest of his Catholic Majesty,
appointed a commissioner to confer with General
Washington on the subject of your letter, accompanying the
representation of Don Juan de Miralles;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and though from
the result of their conference, they have reason to believe
that our grand army cannot be weakened while the enemy
retain their present force at New York, without considerable
danger, yet they have upon mature deliberation determined
rather to incur that danger, than not to comply, as
far as is consistent with our circumstances, with the views
of his Catholic Majesty, to whom they feel themselves
bound by that union of interest, which a common enemy
creates, by the favorable disposition manifested by his
Catholic Majesty to these United States, and by those
ties, which connect the House of Bourbon with the happiness
of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p>Under these impressions they have ordered a considerable
detachment from the grand army to join the troops
in Carolina, which, together with the forces already there
or on the way, will amount to about four thousand men,
exclusive of the militia of the Southern States, whom
Congress have called for upon this occasion. Congress
have also ordered three of their frigates to Charleston, to
be put under the direction of the commanding officer in
that department.</p>

<p>This force they conceive will make so powerful a diversion
in favor of his Catholic Majesty's army, as to afford
probable hopes of their being crowned with success. You
will perceive, Sir, that any other co-operation with the
troops of Spain is impossible, while Savannah opposes a
barrier to a junction of our force. This, from its present
strength, it will not be easy for us to remove, till a more
decided superiority in this quarter enables us to transfer a
greater proportion of our army thither. Unless, in the
meantime, the Governor of Havana shall think proper to
furnish such aid, as when joined with the forces of the
United States in that quarter, will be sufficient to effect the
purposes before mentioned. But as Congress were desirous
of extending their views still further, and conceiving
the conquest of East Florida to be an object of great importance,
as well to his Catholic Majesty, as to these States,
they have therefore directed me to inform you, and through
you Don Juan de Miralles, by whom the intentions of his
Catholic Majesty are communicated, that they have given
full power to their General commanding in the Southern
department to correspond and concert with the Governor
of Havana, or any other person or persons, authorised by
his Catholic Majesty for that purpose, such plan as can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
be agreed upon between them for carrying our views into
execution.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, directed further to inform you, that though
Congress cannot promise any considerable quantity of provisions
until the army of the United States are supplied, yet
as soon as that can be done, every means will be used to
furnish provisions for his Catholic Majesty's Islands and
fleet. But in the meantime they conceive, that a large
supply of rice may be afforded by the State of South Carolina,
while Congress will readily aid the agents of Spain
in procuring the same.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor of transmitting to you the annexed
letter, and copy of a late law of the State of Maryland,
which I have this moment received from Mr William
Smith, a merchant at Baltimore. As it is of a nature to
alarm us in relation to all the operations, which have been
concerted in the Islands, or contemplated with respect to
other places during the course of the ensuing summer;
as, moreover, the vessels and store-ships, which I expect
from Martinique, to supply the place of those which were
destined by the Count d'Estaing for the Chesapeake Bay,
and which the officers of the King have thought it their
duty to sacrifice and sell to the State of Carolina, with a
view to contribute, as far as lay in their power, to the security
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
and defence of that place; as, I say, these store-ships
might arrive immediately, and I might be obliged to
send them back in ballast, if the corn and wheat, which I
have purchased in Maryland, should be seized, and as,
thereby, all my transactions and engagements would not
only become uncertain, but might terminate in a manner
disgraceful to me, and in the failure of the naval operations
of the King in America, I cannot forbear to claim, in the
most urgent manner, the influence of your character with
the Congress of the United States upon this occasion,
while I observe to you, that if the law of Maryland is put
in execution in relation to the provisions, which I have
collected at a great expense and with every possible precaution,
I shall, for the future, be unable to take a single
step in the service of the King, and shall be obliged to pay
large sums to indemnify those with whom I have made
engagements.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is aware of the innumerable difficulties,
which I have experienced since I have been engaged
in this country, in the naval service of the King. They
seem to multiply every moment, and have become so great
that I am compelled to declare to you, that I cannot guaranty
or be answerable for the success of the least operation,
unless you shall be able most speedily to persuade
Congress to take with each and every State in the Union,
decisive and effectual measures to cause respect to be
shown to my transactions, carried on in the name and on
the account of his Majesty; while I repeat my offers to
oblige my agents and correspondents to conform to such
suitable formalities, as your Excellency shall think proper
to prescribe for the general tranquillity and satisfaction.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM SMITH TO M. HOLKER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Baltimore, January 7th, 1780</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>By express I send enclosed a copy of a letter I received
yesterday from the Governor and Council of this
State, in answer to my application for permission to load
the brig Hawk with flour for Cape François, on account of
his Most Christian Majesty. You will perceive by this
letter, that I am not permitted to proceed in loading this
vessel as you direct, nor will any permission for that purpose
be granted until the army is supplied.</p>

<p>That the army ought to be supplied, I doubt not you
will think right; but that the wheat and flour collected
in this port should be taken for that purpose, when I presume
a sufficient quantity may be had much more convenient
to the army and less prejudicial to your interest,
you will, probably, conclude is not so convenient, and
might, if duly considered, have been avoided. I am well
informed that the public purchasers in Harford county have
now on hand upwards of three thousand barrels, which, for
a wagon at this season of the year, are at least three days
nearer camp than this place. Besides, very considerable
magazines must be provided on the eastern shore of this
State; and it seems to me, that the distresses of our army
have arisen more from the want of carriages to convey a
sufficient quantity of flour to camp, than from any other
cause.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I find that the Commissioners for this
county are determined to lay their hands on all your wheat
and flour, and have already seized some of your wheat,
and I doubt not but the whole on the eastern and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
western shores will be taken as soon as they conveniently
can do it. Therefore, I thought it my duty to despatch
this information to you by express, that you may take such
measures in the premises as you judge best. You will see
by the enclosed letter, that no relief is to be expected from
our Governor and Council. Perhaps an application to
Congress may procure a resolve directing your magazines
to be spared, by lending some for the present emergency.
But that ought to be taken when most convenient for the
army, and least prejudicial to you.</p>

<p>You will please to favor me with a line by return of the
bearer, directing whatever steps you may think will be
most conducive to the interest of his Most Christian
Majesty.</p>

<h3>THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MARYLAND TO
WILLIAM SMITH.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Council, Annapolis, January 6th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>We received your favor of the 3d instant by express.
As the grand object of the "Acts for the immediate supply
of the army, &amp;c." is to procure an immediate and full
supply of provisions for <i>our</i> army, it was necessary that
the Commissioners should be vested with extraordinary
powers, that those powers should be accurately defined,
and that the mode to be pursued by them should be plainly
delineated; which is done. We do not think that flour or
wheat purchased for the Marine of France, privileged or
exempted from seizure, and we are certain it was not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
intention of the Legislature that those articles should be,
because such exemption would, in a great degree, if not
wholly, frustrate the design of the law.</p>

<p>We deem it our duty to afford the Commissioners every
aid in our power to facilitate the execution of the law, and,
therefore, cannot at this time grant permission to export
flour or wheat purchased by the agents of France; because
we should thereby restrain that extensive operation
of the act, by which alone we can obtain an immediate
supply adequate to our pressing wants. We are sensible,
that it is of importance that the Marine of France should
be furnished with flour, and it is with the utmost regret

Philadelphia, January 10th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary of France,
has just received from M. Holker a letter, of which a copy
is annexed, in relation to a law, passed by the State of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Maryland, to authorise the Commissioners therein named
to seize the grain, corn, and rice, which may be found
stored in the hands of individuals in that State, and to
carry them away. It is to be presumed, that if the General
Assembly of Maryland had been informed of the
measures taken, at a great expense, to procure supplies
for the fleets of his Majesty and for his garrisons in the
French Islands, and of the pressing wants which they
suffer, they would have excepted from this law the provisions
found in the hands of Mr Smith.</p>

<p>The undersigned is about to take suitable measures for
inducing the government to refrain from seizing the said
provisions, and to replace them in case that they are
already seized. He earnestly entreats Congress to be
pleased, on its part, to recommend to the Councils and
Assemblies of the Thirteen States to refrain, in circumstances
of this nature, and in all other cases, from all
measures which may cause any uncertainty in the operations
of the King's Navy Agents, endanger the success of
the plans of the campaign, and expose to want and to the
greatest inconveniences the garrisons of the French Islands,
the governors of which are previously informed of the
measures taken to procure supplies for them in the United
States, and in concert with Congress and the respective
governments of the States.</p>

<p>The present juncture being of a very pressing nature,
the undersigned entreats Congress to be pleased to come
to a decision on this subject as quickly as possible. He,
moreover, proposes to the Council of Maryland to subject
the agents and Commissioners, charged with making purchases
on account of his Majesty, to all the legal forms
best adapted to prevent every kind of abuse on their part;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
and he is desirous that the States, in which purchases
of this nature may be made, should be pleased to take
similar measures.</p>

<h3>TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, January 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Advices recently received from Europe make mention
of the efforts, which the English have made in Germany
to procure recruits and new levies, and of the difficulty
they have experienced even on the part of those Courts
with whom they had before treated. The greatest part
of the German Princes, who have sold soldiers to the
Court of London, now blush at these sales, which have
excited their subjects against them, and which besides
have drained their States. They are reluctant to give
troops to a power, that is making war against France, with
whom they have always preserved amicable ties, and I am
assured, that it is even doubtful whether the English will be
able to procure a few recruits to complete the corps they
have in America.</p>

<p>I am informed, that these circumstances have determined
the British government to make every effort to
obtain men in America, whom they cannot procure in
Europe, and that Mr Clinton has received orders to spare
no pains to effect the exchange or deliverance of the troops
of the Convention of Saratoga, and of other prisoners, who
are in the hands of the Americans. It is added, that the
want of the Court of London for soldiers is so pressing, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
General Clinton has been authorised to surmount all the
difficulties, which may arise in the negotiation of this exchange,
and that he is even permitted in case of absolute necessity
to treat with Congress, or their Ministers, on
terms of perfect equality, and as with an independent
power. He has also equally full liberty to agree upon the
number of private soldiers, who may be given in exchange
for an officer of any rank whatsoever; and they order him
simply to remember in treating of this matter, that an English
soldier transported to America is of an infinite price to
England, and they exhort him to employ all his efforts to
bring about an exchange whatever may be the conditions.</p>

<p>I hasten to communicate these interesting ideas to Congress,
and I have learned, that they were confirmed by the
event, and that Major General Phillips had in effect drawn
on a negotiation, the progress of which had been entirely
confided to your Excellency. They prayed me at the
same time to send you a communication of these objects,
which the Congress think ought greatly to influence the
measures, which it will be in your power to take, when
you know that the English Commissioners have orders to
pass over all difficulties, and to grant all the demands,
which may be made, rather than to lose the occasion of
reinforcing the army they have upon this continent.</p>

<p>I join to this some extracts, the contents of which have
appeared to me of a nature to interest your Excellency.
You will see besides, Sir, by the despatch of the British
Minister, with what affectation he seeks to make the Thirteen
States to be considered as subjected to the English
domination, and you will judge of what importance it is to
you to treat with the Court of London upon the footing of
perfect equality, and how useful an act of this nature may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
be to the negotiations of Congress in Europe, when they
can add to all the facts, of which the Court of Madrid makes
mention in its memoir, a cartel regulated on the footing of
perfect parity, and which would prejudge beforehand the
question of your independence. I congratulate myself, that
this negotiation is in your hands, and I am well persuaded,
that nothing will pass derogatory to the part, which my
Court has taken in acknowledging the independence and
the perfect sovereignty of the United States.</p>

<p>I shall intrust to your Excellency, that the King is disposed
to send over succors to this continent, of arms and
ammunition, but as the events of the sea are uncertain, I
believe that it will be proper to make no change in the
measures, which may have been taken otherwise to procure
them. This news not having reached me till yesterday,
I have not yet been able to make a communication
of it to Congress.</p>

<p>As you may be retained in your quarters by important
considerations, I propose to go to render you my duties
in the course of the next month, and confer with your
Excellency on objects of great importance, and relative to
the measures necessary to push the next campaign with
vigor, and to put the American army in a condition truly
proper to hold the enemy in check upon the continent,
whilst his Majesty and the King of Spain shall display in
the other parts of the world all their forces to secure advantageous
terms of peace to the allies.</p>

<p class="indent1">
I am, with respect, Sir,</p>

<p class="signed">LUZERNE.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> This letter will be delivered to your Excellency
by M. de Galvan, who has been raised to the rank of Major
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
by your goodness; he desires to merit it anew, and prays
me to solicit you to put his zeal in activity. I shall be
very grateful for what you may be pleased to do for him.
He was particularly recommended to me by the Minister
of France. He appeared to me to merit a great deal from
his zeal, and from his personal attachment to your Excellency.</p>

and secured the liberty and estates of persons of
every condition, and let all sort of violence against the
respective subjects, or against the estates or effects which
they possess, be made to cease. During this truce, the
French may treat upon their particular concerns, avoiding
thereby the suspicions, to which they would necessarily

their private advantage relatively to the pretended interests

<p class="blockquot"><i>Ultimatum proposed by the Court of Madrid to the Courts
of France and England, dated 3d of April, 1779.</i></p>

<p>If these overtures or propositions had arrived here immediately
after the King had made his to adjust the plan
of reconciliation, several difficulties might have been some
time since removed, by the modifications, which might
have been negotiated, counting upon good faith and reciprocal
confidence, as well as the desire of obtaining a peace;
but after having lost more than two months, without reckoning
the time that uselessly passed before, and after having
observed that during this interval they did not cease
to make great preparations of war, it must necessarily be
suspected, that the object of England is to let glide away
the months, which the campaign might still last, to continue
the war with vigor. In this case all the efforts of the King
to bring back the belligerent powers to peace would be
ineffectual. Nevertheless, his Majesty, wishing to give one
more proof of his love of humanity, and to make it appear
that he has neglected nothing to stop and prevent the
calamities of war, has ordered to propose to the two Courts
the following plan, which will be on his part an ultimatum
in this affair.</p>

<p>"That there shall be an unlimited suspension of arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
with France on the condition, that neither of the belligerent
powers can break it without advertising the other a year
beforehand.</p>

<p>"That with a view of re-establishing reciprocal security
and good faith between the two Crowns, by means of this
suspension of hostilities, there shall be a general disarming
in the space of one month on the side of Europe, in four
months on that of America, and in eight months or a year
for those of Africa and of Asia the most remote.</p>

<p>"That they shall determine in a month the place where
the Plenipotentiaries of the two Courts shall assemble, to
treat of a definitive accommodation of peace, and to regulate
the restitutions or compensations relative to the reprisals,
which have been made without adjudication of war,
and to other grievances or pretensions of one or the other
Crown. For this purpose the King will continue his mediation,
offering in the first place the city of Madrid to
hold a Congress.</p>

<p>"That the King of Great Britain shall grant a like
cessation of hostilities to the American Colonies, by the
intercession and mediation of his Catholic Majesty, a year
beforehand, to the end, that he may apprize the said
American Provinces, that they are equally ordered to
make a reciprocal disarming at the epochas, and for the
spaces of time, which have been specified with regard to
France.</p>

<p>"That the bounds be fixed beyond which neither of
the two parties shall pass from the positions and territories,
in which it shall be at the time of the ratification of this
arrangement.</p>

<p>"That they may send to Madrid one or more Commissioners
on the part of the Colonies, and that his Britannic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Majesty may also send others on his part under the mediation
of the King, if necessary, in order to adjust all
those points and others, which respect this suspension
of arms, and the effects which it ought to produce,
so long as it shall subsist, and that during this interval the
Colonies shall be treated as independent in fact. That
in case all the belligerent powers, or any others among
them, or even the Colonies themselves, demand that the
treaties or accommodations, which are concluded, be guarantied
by those powers and by Spain, they shall in effect
be so guarantied. And the Catholic King now offers his
guarantee for the preliminaries."</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Extract from the Exposition of the Motives of the Court
of Spain relative to England.</i></p>

<p>Among the propositions of the ultimatum of the King
of Spain, there is one for which the British Cabinet has
affected to have the greatest repugnance, and that is the
proposition which imparts, that the Colonies shall be treated
as independent <i>in fact</i>, during the interval of the truce.
It is extraordinary, since it is even ridiculous, that the
Court of London after having treated the Colonies during
the war as independent, not only <i>in fact</i>, but also <i>of right</i>,
should have any repugnance to treat them as independent
only <i>in fact</i>, during the truce, or suspension of arms. The
Convention of Saratoga, General Burgoyne considered as
a lawful prisoner, the exchange and liberation of other
Colonial prisoners, the nomination of Commissioners to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
meet the Americans at their own homes, the act of having
asked peace of them, and to treat with them, or with Congress,
and a hundred other facts of this nature, authorised
by the Court of London, have been genuine signs of an
acknowledgment of the independence of the Colonies.</p>

<p>It is the English nation itself, who can best judge and
decide, whether all these acts are as compatible with the
honor of the British Crown, as would be that of granting
to the Colonies, by the interposition of his Catholic Majesty,
a suspension of arms to discuss their differences, and to
treat them during this interval as independent <i>in fact</i>.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, January 25th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has received
express orders from the King, his master, to inform Congress,
that the present situation of the affairs of the alliance
in Europe announces the necessity of another campaign,
which is indispensable to bring England to an acknowledgment
of the independence of the Thirteen United
States, which is the essential purpose of the present war.
That power is making preparations the most proper for
continuing the war with vigor, and appears willing to employ,
in the course of this year, all the means possible to
procure reparation, by some important enterprise, for
the losses it has already sustained. Congress cannot
doubt, that in this situation of affairs his Most Christian
Majesty and the King of Spain have concerted plans
to maintain that superiority by sea, which has begun to
appear in their favor; and the underwritten has reason
to believe, that the United States have nothing to desire
of their ally, touching the use he is making of the resources
of his realm, and the efficacy of the measures adopted by
the Cabinets of Versailles and Madrid.</p>

<p>But while this powerful diversion retains in Europe, and
the West Indies, the greater part of the land and sea
forces of the common enemy, it is absolutely necessary,
that the United States, on their part, should make efforts
proportionable to the greatness of the object for which they
are contending. The only means of putting an end to
the calamities of the war is to push it with new vigor;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
to take effectual measures immediately for completing
the army and putting it in condition to begin an early campaign.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to concert, as far as the distance of
places will permit, a plan of common operations; and this
is one of the principal points on which the underwritten
Minister is ordered to consult with Congress. He is also
ordered to assure this Assembly, that the King being informed
of the wants of the American army, with respect
to arms and ammunition, has commanded his Ministers to
make suitable arrangements for supplying them. It is necessary
that the underwritten Minister should confer with
Congress on the subjects just mentioned. Besides, he has
some particular circumstances to communicate relative to
the present or probable state of the negotiations; and he
desires that this assembly will be pleased to inform him in
what manner they will receive the communication, the subject
of which, as well as the plan of operations for the
ensuing campaign, requires the most profound secrecy.
In the meanwhile, he now only assures Congress, that in
the whole course of the negotiations carried on last year,
the King would not listen to either peace or truce, without
an assurance, of some sort, of the independence of the
United States.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF A COMMITTEE ON THE COMMUNICATIONS OF
THE FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, January 28th, 1780.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to receive the communications
of the Minister of France, reported the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
summary, accompanied with extracts of papers, which he
had recently received.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The Minister of France informed the Committee, that
he had it in command from his King to impress upon the
minds of Congress, that the British Cabinet have an almost
insuperable reluctance to admit the idea of the independence
of these United States, and will use every possible
endeavor to prevent it. That they have filled several of
the Courts of Europe with negotiations, in order to excite
them to a war against France, or to obtain succors;
and are employing the most strenuous endeavors to persuade
the several powers, that the United States are disposed
to enter into treaties of accommodation. That many
persons in Europe are actually employed in bringing such
treaties to perfection; and that they have no doubt of their
success. That the objects which the British Cabinet hope
for from those measures are, to destroy the superiority,
which France has now at sea, by diverting her powers
and resources from naval to land operations, and by engaging
her in a land war, where she must risk very important
interests, while England would risk nothing but money;
or to break, or weaken the alliance, by destroying the confidence,
which the allies ought to have in each other.</p>

<p>That his Most Christian Majesty gives no credit to the
suggestions of Britain, relative to the disposition of the
United States; and it is necessary, that measures be taken
for the preventing of other powers from being deceived
into a belief of them. That the negotiations of Britain, as
far as could yet be learned, had not succeeded. That the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
dispositions of all the European powers are, as far as can
be known, very friendly to France; but some of them
may be engaged in secret treaties with Britain, which may
oblige them, in some event, to assist her with troops even
against their inclinations. That such event may arise, and
if it should, it is probable it will produce an armed mediation,
the consequences of which would be, that the allies
must accept of the terms proposed by the mediator, or continue
the war under the disadvantage of having the forces
of the mediator united with those of their enemies. That
in such event, it is possible the terms proposed will be
such as Spain offered, and Britain rejected, in the last
proposed mediation.</p>

<p>That, though the powers who may be under such engagements
by treaty to Great Britain, from their friendly
disposition towards his Most Christian Majesty, may be
very unwilling to give assistance to his enemies, yet they
may find it indispensably necessary in compliance with
their engagements; but it is not improbable that their reluctance,
or the distance of their dominions, may delay
such assistance, if granted at all, so as to be too late for
the next campaign. That should the enemy be in possession
of any part of the United States at the close of the
next campaign, it will be extremely difficult to bring Great
Britain to acknowledge their independence; and if a mediator
should be offered, while the enemy is in possession
of any part, an impartial mediator could not easily refute
the arguments, which might be used for its retaining such
possessions. And, probably, a mediator well disposed
towards Great Britain might insist on her holding them;
and if not agreed to, the hostility of such a mediator would
be the necessary consequence. That should Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Britain form such alliances, or procure such aids, as are
the objects of her present negotiations, there will be every
reason to fear a long and an obstinate war, whereof the
final event may be doubtful.</p>

<p>That this view of affairs plainly points out the necessity
for the greatest possible vigor in the operations of the next
campaign, in order to dispossess the enemy of every part
of the United States, and to put them in condition to treat
of peace, and accept of a mediation with the greatest advantage;
and the preparations for it ought to be as speedy
and as effectual as possible. That France and Spain are
prepared to make a very powerful diversion, and will exert
themselves most strenuously for preserving and improving
their naval superiority, and for employing the powers of
the enemy in Europe and the West Indies. The Minister
declared, as from himself, that he doubted not his Most
Christian Majesty will spare some ships to the United
States, if it can be done without endangering his superiority
at sea; and that an application made to the Minister
informally is more eligible than to the King, because it
would give his Majesty great pain to refuse the request,
though he might be in no condition to grant it. That at
all events, supplies should be prepared on a supposition
that the ships will be granted; and such supplies should
be put into the hands of the Agent for the Marine of
France, and considered as the King's property.</p>

<p>He desires to be informed, as far as Congress may
deem proper, what force the United States can bring into
the field next campaign? On what resources they rely for
their maintenance and necessary appointments? And what
shall be the general plan of the campaign, on supposition
either of having, or not having the aid of ships of war?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
He gives it as his opinion, that an application for clothing
may be made to his Most Christian Majesty with prospect
of success; and although measures have been taken for
sending arms and warlike stores to America, yet it would
be prudent in Congress not to neglect any other means for
procuring those supplies, or supplies of clothing.</p>

<h3>ANSWER OF CONGRESS TO THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE
FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, January 31st, 1780.</p>

<p>Congress taking into consideration the communications
of the French Minister, as reported by the committee on
the 28th instant,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the following answer be given to the
communications of the honorable the Minister Plenipotentiary
of France;</p>

<p>That Congress entertain the most grateful sense of the unremitting
attention given to the interests of the United States
by their illustrious ally; and consider the communications
made to them by his Minister under his Majesty's special
command as equally wise and interesting. That the confidence
which they repose in his Majesty, in consequence of
his so generously interesting himself in the affairs of these
United States, and the wisdom and magnanimity of his
councils, determine them to give the most perfect information
in their power of their resources, their views, and their
expectations.</p>

<p>That to this end, they state as follows; that the United
States have expectations, on which they can rely with
confidence, of bringing into the field an army of twentyfive
thousand effective men, exclusive of commissioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
officers. That this army can be reinforced by militia so
as to be in force sufficient for any enterprises against
the posts occupied by the enemy within the United
States. That supplies of provisions for the army in its
greatest number can certainly be obtained within the
United States; and the Congress, with the co-operation of
the several States, can take effectual measures for procuring
them in such manner as that no operation will be
impeded. That provisions, also, for such of the forces of
his Most Christian Majesty, as may be employed in conjunction
or co-operation with those of the United States,
can be procured under the direction of Congress; and
such provisions shall be laid up in magazines, agreeably
to such instructions as his Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary
shall give; and the magazines shall be put under the
direction of the Agent of the Marine of France.</p>

<p>That Congress rely on the contributions of the States
by taxes, and on moneys to be raised by internal loans,
for the pay of the army. That supplies of clothing, of
tents, of arms and warlike stores, must be principally obtained
from foreign nations; and the United States must
rely chiefly on the assistance of their ally for them; but
every other means for procuring them are already taken,
and will be prosecuted with the greatest diligence.</p>

<p>That the United States, with the assistance of a competent
naval force, would willingly, during the next campaign,
carry on the most vigorous offensive operations
against the enemy in all the posts occupied by them within
the United States. That without such naval force, little
more can be attempted by them than straitening the quarters
of the enemy, and covering the interior parts of the
country. That their forces must be disposed in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
manner as to oppose the enemy with the greatest effect,
wheresoever their most considerable operations may be
directed.</p>

<p>That at present, the Southern States seem to be their
principal object, and their design to establish themselves in
one or more of them; but their superiority at sea over the
United States enables them to change their objects and
operations with great facility, while those of the United
States are rendered difficult by the great extent of country
they have to defend.</p>

<p>That Congress are happy to find that his Most Christian
Majesty gives no credit to the suggestions of the British
cabinet relative to the dispositions of the United States,
or any of them, to enter into treaties of accommodation
with Great Britain; and wish his Majesty and all the
powers of Europe to be assured, that such suggestions are
insidious and without foundation.</p>

<p>That it will appear by the constitutions and other public
acts of the several States, that the citizens of the United
States possessed of arms, possessed of freedom, possessed
of political power to create and direct their magistrates as
they think proper, are united in their determinations to
secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of
liberty, by supporting the independence of their governments,
and observing their treaties and public engagements
with immovable firmness and fidelity. And the Congress
assure his Majesty, that should any individual in America
be found base enough to show the least disposition for persuading
the people to the contrary, such individual would
instantly lose all power of effecting his purpose, by forfeiting
the esteem and confidence of the people.</p>

<h3>COMMUNICATIONS OF THE FRENCH MINISTER TO A COMMITTEE
OF CONGRESS AT A SECOND CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, February 2d, 1780.</p>

<p>The Committee report, that in a second conference
with the honorable the Minister Plenipotentiary of France
he communicated to them;</p>

<p>That his Most Christian Majesty, being uninformed of
the appointment of a Minister Plenipotentiary to treat of
an alliance between the United States and his Catholic
Majesty, has signified to his Minister Plenipotentiary to the
United States, that he wishes most earnestly for such an
alliance; and in order to make the way thereto more
easy, has commanded him to communicate to the Congress
certain articles, which his Catholic Majesty deems of great
importance to the interests of his Crown, and on which it
is highly necessary that the United States explain themselves
with precision, and with such moderation as may
consist with their essential rights.</p>

<p>That the articles are,</p>

<p>1st. A precise and invariable western boundary to the
United States.</p>

<p>2dly. The exclusive navigation of the river Mississippi.</p>

<p>3dly. The possession of the Floridas; and</p>

<p>4thly. The lands on the left or eastern side of the
river Mississippi.</p>

<p>That on the first article, it is the idea of the cabinet of
Madrid, that the United States extend to the westward no
farther than settlements were permitted by the royal proclamation
bearing date the &mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash; 1763.</p>

<p>On the second, that the United States do not consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
themselves as having any right to navigate the river Mississippi,
no territory belonging to them being situated thereon.</p>

<p>On the third, that it is probable that the King of Spain
will conquer the Floridas during the course of the present
war; and in such event, every cause of dispute relative
thereto between Spain and these United States ought to
be removed.</p>

<p>On the fourth, that the lands lying on the east side of
the Mississippi, whereon the settlements were prohibited
by the aforesaid proclamation, are possessions of the Crown
of Great Britain, and proper objects against which the
arms of Spain may be employed, for the purpose of
making a permanent conquest for the Spanish Crown.
That such conquest may, probably, be made during the
present war. That, therefore, it would be advisable to
restrain the Southern States from making any settlements
or conquests in those territories. That the Council of
Madrid consider the United States as having no claims to
those territories, either as not having had possession of
them before the present war, or not having any foundation
for a claim in the right of the sovereignty of Great Britain,
whose dominion they have abjured.</p>

<p>That his Most Christian Majesty, united to the Catholic
King by blood and by the strictest alliances, and united
with these States in treaties of alliance, and feeling towards
them dispositions of the most perfect friendship, is exceedingly
desirous of conciliating between his Catholic Majesty
and these United States, the most happy and lasting
friendship.</p>

<p>That the United States may repose the utmost confidence
in his good will to their interests, and in the justice
and liberality of his Catholic Majesty; and that he cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
deem the revolution, which has set up the independence of
these United States, as past all danger of unfavorable
events, until his Catholic Majesty and the United States
shall be established on those terms of confidence and amity,
which are the objects of his Most Christian Majesty's very
earnest wishes.</p>

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Head Quarters, Morristown, February 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Major Galvan delivered me the letter, which your Excellency
did me the honor to write to me on the 23d of
January, to which I have paid all the attention the importance
of its contents demands. I am much flattered by
this commencement of a correspondence, from which I
have everything to gain, and equally indebted for the interesting
communications it affords.</p>

<p>It is a happy circumstance, that the efforts made by the
British Court for obtaining troops in Germany are attended
with so little success. This will naturally increase their
exertions for procuring men in this country, and will, no
doubt, make them more solicitous for effecting the exchange
or release in some way or other, of their prisoners
in our hands. It will be well, if in the negotiations on this
subject, we can extract concessions favorable to those,
which may take place in Europe, and you may depend
the experiment shall be fully tried. But from the aspect
of the late propositions on the part of the enemy, I should
not entertain any sanguine hopes of the success of this experiment.
The reinforcement they would derive from a
full compliance with their proposals is not calculated at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
more than ten or eleven hundred private men; and this
seems hardly to be an object of sufficient magnitude to
induce them to concede to points of the nature, which your
Excellency's information supposes; especially, as you emphatically
express it, "after having sought with so much
affectation to make the Thirteen States be considered as
subjected to the English domination." The offers made
through Major General Phillips are far more moderate,
than any that have hitherto come from them, and appear,
in a great measure, to have been influenced by his personal
solicitations, dictated by an extreme anxiety to be
released from captivity. But notwithstanding the matter
in its present form wears to me the appearance I have
mentioned, I shall not neglect any measure, which it may
be in my power to take, to improve the intimation your
Excellency has given, and entreat you to be assured, that
I shall endeavor to make the event confirm the opinion
you do me the honor to entertain, that nothing will be
done derogatory to the magnanimous part your Court has
acted, or the honor or interest of the United States.</p>

<p>The inconsistency of the Court of London, so well delineated
by that of Madrid in the extract you had the
goodness to annex, would appear extraordinary, if their
whole conduct in the course of the war did not exhibit
many similar examples. But it is evident, that their refusing
to consider these States as independent in fact,
during a negotiation, was a mere pretext to cover their
unwillingness to concur in the pacific views of His
Catholic Majesty; and the Memorial from the British
Ambassador shows, that they were artfully aiming to
effect a separation of interests between France and
these States, the better to prosecute their hostile designs
against either or both.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<p>I thank your Excellency for the agreeable intelligence
you give me of his Christian Majesty's intentions
to send over succors of arms and ammunition.
It is a new and valuable proof of his friendship, and
will be of essential utility. I agree with you, that
there ought to be no relaxation in the measures otherwise
intended to be taken to procure the necessary
supplies of those articles.</p>

<p>I am sensibly mortified, that the present situation of
affairs will by no means suffer me to yield to the desire
I have of paying you my respects in Philadelphia; and
I shall impatiently look for the opportunity of doing it
here, which your Excellency promises me in the course
of this month. Besides the important objects of public
utility, which I am authorised to hope from it, I shall
take pleasure on every occasion of testifying to you
those sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I
have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signed">
GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> The interest your Excellency is pleased to
take in Major Galvan, will be an additional motive
with me to avail myself of his talents and zeal, as far
as circumstances will possibly permit.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Head Quarters, Morristown, February 15th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
Excellency's letter of the 4th,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which only reached
me on the 13th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>Sincerely desirous of doing everything in my power,
by which the interest of his Christian Majesty, inseparable
from that of these States, can in any manner be
promoted, and still more in a point so essential as that
which makes the subject of your letter, I should not
hesitate to furnish the detachment required by Mr
Duer, whatever might be my opinion of its necessity,
did not the present state of the army absolutely forbid
it. I with confidence assure your Excellency, that our
force is so reduced by the expiration of the terms for
which a considerable part of it was engaged, and will
be so much more diminished in the course of a month
or two from the same cause, as scarcely to suffice for
the exigence of the service, and to afford just cause for
uneasiness should the enemy be actuated by a spirit of
enterprise, before we receive the reinforcements intended
for the next campaign. So circumstanced, my
duty to the common cause will not justify me in adding
to the insecurity of our situation, by making a detachment,
which, though apparently inconsiderable, would
be materially felt in our present weakness; and I am
persuaded, after the information now given, that your
Excellency will wish me not to hazard the measure.</p>

<p>With respect to the necessity of a covering party, I
shall not venture to decide; but I should imagine in
the present state of things, that the business may be carried
on with tolerable security without one. The consequences
of the late expedition promise tranquillity for
some time to our frontier, and make it at any rate
improbable that the savages will be able to penetrate
so far at so early a period, and the proposition does not
require that the covering party should remain longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
than until the last of April. The intelligence I have
received corresponds with these ideas. It might be
added, that the garrison at Wyoming gives some degree
of protection to the part of the country in question.
But as it is very important, that no interruption
should be given to the workmen, if a covering party
should upon the whole be thought requisite, the best
mode of furnishing it will be from the neighboring
militia. For this purpose on your Excellency's application
to Congress, I cannot doubt they will immediately
make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, with the most respect and
attachment, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of France,
has the honor of informing Congress, that the King, in consequence
of his affection, and friendship for the United
States, and of his desire to put an end by effectual measures
to the calamities of the present war, has resolved to
send to this continent a reinforcement of troops, intended
to act against the common enemy, and of vessels, which
will be employed in assisting the operations of the land
troops. As soon as Congress has decided on the plan of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
the campaign, the Marquis de Lafayette will receive all
communications on this subject; and will on his part make
the overtures, which shall be necessary to the success of
the operations. But as despatch and secrecy ought to be
the very soul of these operations, and as, moreover, Congress
will undoubtedly find it indispensable to arrange
them in concert with the Commander in Chief, the Chevalier
de la Luzerne requests this Assembly to consider,
whether the course most proper to be adopted under these
circumstances be not to appoint, without the least delay,
a small committee, who shall repair to the army, furnished
with instructions, and there fix upon measures, which shall
be carried into execution immediately on the arrival of the
land forces, under the command of the Count de Rochambeau,
Lieutenant General of the armies of the King, and
the Chevalier de Ternay, commander of the squadron, at
whatever part of the continent they may have had orders
to land.</p>

<p>As the measures to be taken, in relation to the supply of
necessaries and provisions to the auxiliary troops, will require
the concurrence of the Legislatures and Governors
of the several States, and particularly of those of Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, the undersigned
Minister requests Congress to authorise the
same committee to render their assistance to the measures,
which the French General, or the Chevalier de la Luzerne,
or the Commissioners authorised by them, shall be able to
take with the different Legislatures; and with this view,
to give to the delegates, who shall compose it, powers as
extensive as Congress shall deem expedient.</p>

<p>An object, which next to that just mentioned, requires
all the attention of Congress, is the information, which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
is important to obtain as to the forces, the situation, and
the resources of the enemy, in all the posts in their possession
on this continent. The Chevalier de la Luzerne
is consequently desirous, that Congress would be pleased
to appoint a committee to collect immediately all the intelligence,
details, and information, which may exist in
their deposits and archives, relative to the ports of North
America, now held by the English, from Halifax to St
Augustine, including Canada, to the depth of the bays,
creeks, and anchorages; to the forces which are stationed
there, and the forts and fortresses, which have been erected
there, the dispositions and number of the inhabitants, the
resources with regard to provisions, and in general, all
that information, which may promote the success of the
operations. It is equally desirable, that this committee
should have authority to carry on a correspondence, as
long as may be necessary, in the different parts of the
continent, whence this information can be obtained, in
order that the intelligence being always fresh, the commanders
of the expeditions may be able to establish their
plans upon sure bases. The Minister of France requests,
that the committee may be authorised to communicate to
him this various information, so far as such communication
shall not be inconvenient to Congress. Whatever promptness
these measures require, the Chevalier de la Luzerne
prays Congress not to take them into consideration, till
after the subject mentioned at the beginning of this Memorial
has been definitively settled.</p>

<p>Dr Franklin has undoubtedly rendered an account to
Congress of the measures, which he has taken for sending
to this continent arms, stores, and clothing, as well as of
the means of facilitating the loan of three millions of livres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
which that Minister has procured, as well to meet this expense,
as to give effect to the treaties of Congress in relation
to it; and the Chevalier de la Luzerne will not go
into any detail on this subject.</p>

<p>He will not close this Memorial, without congratulating
the American Senate on the zeal and ardor, which are
shown on every side to render the ensuing campaign decisive,
and to inflict upon the common enemy blows, which
shall be most sensibly felt, to expel him from this country
without the possibility of return, and to secure forever the
liberty of the Thirteen States.</p>

<p>Circumstances have never been more favorable; the
enemy, hard-pressed on every side, is not in a state to oppose
an effectual resistance; the American forces are
about to become more respectable than they have ever
been, those of the King bring with them to this country
the most sincere desire to second the brave efforts of their
allies, and the two nations closely united for the purpose
of bringing their combined enterprises to a successful issue,
will seek only to distinguish themselves by their zeal, and
their attachment to the common cause.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, May 24th, 1780.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to confer with the Minister
of France on the subject of supplies and other matters
mentioned in this appointment, report as follows.</p>

<p>That in their first conference with the Minister, he mentioned
his solicitude to procure the necessary provisions
for the fleet and army of his Most Christian Majesty; that
he wished to render every step he should take on this subject
conformable to the designs of Congress, and conducive
to the support of the combined forces; that he would
therefore lay before the committee the measures, that he
had already entered into, and was desirous to agree upon
any plan for our mutual benefit, which we should think it
proper to adopt.</p>

<p>That previous to our appointment, the moments being
precious, he had despatched an agent to consult the Commander
in Chief and General Greene on the subject of supplies,
and would inform us of their sentiments at his return;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
that lest his purchases might interfere with those, which
the States should make on account of the continent, he had
thought it most advisable to let the whole business pass
through their hands, and had accordingly written to Governor
Trumbull for a limited supply of beef, pork, and
mutton, leaving it to his option, either to be paid in bills
upon France, specie, or continental bills of credit.</p>

<p>The committee have stated this information, that Congress
may, if they should find it necessary, give them their
directions before they digest any plan with the Minister of
France on the return of his agent.</p>

<p>The committee conceive the establishment of posts and
expresses, who shall bring the earliest intelligence of the
arrival of the fleet of our ally, and the motions of the enemy,
as so necessary to the right application of our force,
that they submit the following resolution.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Committee of Intelligence be directed
to establish regular posts to and from the different parts
of the sea coasts of this continent, from Charleston to Boston,
in such manner as will most effectually procure information
of the approach of the fleet of our ally, and the
movements of the enemy in consequence thereof.</p>

<p>The committee are further of opinion, from the representations
of the Minister of France, that every means
should be used to add to the strength of the fleet of our
ally on their arrival, particularly by completing the ship
America, since it is highly probable, that the naval force,
which the enemy may send to this coast, in order to frustrate
the friendly endeavors of our ally in our behalf, will
be adapted to that of France, without taking into the calculation
any addition which it may receive here. They
therefore submit the following resolutions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span></p>

<p>Resolved, that the Board of Admiralty be directed to
fit for sea, with the utmost expedition, the several ships of
war and frigates now in port.</p>

<p>Resolved, that it be earnestly recommended to the respective
States within whose ports any of the said ships or
frigates may be, to afford every assistance to the Board of
Admiralty on this application for artificers, laborers, and
materials, for preparing the same for sea, and for completing
this compliment of men.</p>

<p>Resolved, that Congress will defray every necessary
expense, which any State shall incur in consequence of
the above resolution.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Board of Admiralty be empowered,
if they shall think it advisable to dispose of the Saratoga,
to apply the proceeds thereof to complete the America, or
any of the frigates, which may by that means be shortly
fitted for sea.</p>

<p>And whereas it is proper to make provision for repairing
any damage, which the fleets of our ally may sustain
by storms or otherwise,</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Board of Admiralty be directed to
cause as many masts, yards, and spars, as they shall deem
necessary for the above purposes to be procured.</p>

<p>Resolved, that they may be also directed to settle signals
with the commanding officers of any ship or ships of
our ally, which may now or shall hereafter be upon the
coasts of the United States.</p>

<p>And for the promoting of harmony and forwarding the
common views of France and America, it was further
agreed between the Minister of France and your committee,
that they should suggest to Congress the propriety of
adopting measures to prevent desertion from the fleet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
army of our allies, in which view they submit the following
resolution.</p>

<p>Resolved, that it be recommended to the legislation of
these United States, to pass laws for the punishment of
such persons as shall encourage desertions from the fleets
or armies of any foreign power, who shall prosecute the
war in America in conjunction with these United States,
and for the recovering such deserters as shall endeavor
to conceal themselves among the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>My time has been so entirely engrossed in the preliminary
arrangements of immediate necessity towards the intended
co-operation, that I have not been able till now to
do myself the honor to thank your Excellency for your

the general zeal of your countrymen in the cause of America,
not to be entirely convinced of it, and to feel all that
the most grateful sensibility can inspire.</p>

<p>I am happy in believing, that the troops and citizens of
these States will eagerly embrace every opportunity to
manifest their affection to the troops and citizens of your
nation, as well as their gratitude and veneration to a Prince,
from whom they have received the most important benefits.
Penetrated with a sense of these, I shall think it my
duty to cultivate correspondent sentiments, as far as my
influence extends.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette has given me an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
all your Excellency has done for the advancement of the

of the two countries.</p>

<p>I am too sensible of the value of the permission you
gave me to solicit your aid in everything, in which you
can continue to afford us your good offices, not to make

<h3>REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS RESPECTING
COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, June 5th, 1780.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to receive the communications
of his Excellency, the Minister of France, relating
to supplies for the forces of his Most Christian
Majesty, and on other matters, beg leave to report, that
in a conference had on the 3d of the present month,
the Minister was pleased to make the following communications,
viz.</p>

<p>That M. de Corney, Commissary of the troops of
his Most Christian Majesty, had orders to purchase a
number of horses, and to purchase or hire a number of
teams in the States where they could be most conveniently
procured, for the use of the forces of his
Most Christian Majesty, that should arrive to co-operate
with the forces of these United States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span></p>

<p>That M. de Corney had also orders to endeavor to
procure in the several States, where it should be found
most convenient, provisions for the forces above mentioned,
in such manner as should least interfere with
the purchaser of the States or agents of Congress, and
as should be best adapted to support and establish the
credit of the paper currency. That M. de Corney
would apply to the supreme executive powers of the
several States, in which the purchases were to be made,
for their advice and aid in the matter.</p>

<p>To obtain which, the Minister wished for the approbation
of Congress, and that if they should think fit,
letters might be written by the President to the supreme
executive powers of the several States, requesting
their advice and aid to M. de Corney in procuring
those supplies.</p>

<p>That M. de Corney had received £7000 of the bills
lately emitted by the State of Pennsylvania, to use for
the purposes above mentioned, and would in his negotiations
avail himself of all opportunities for contributing
to the utmost of his power for establishing the
currency of the public bills of credit.</p>

<p>That it would be necessary to give the said forces of
his Most Christian Majesty the option of receiving
their pay in specie, from their unacquaintedness with
paper money in general, and ignorance of the language
in which the bills of these United States are struck.</p>

<p>Which circumstance the Minister thought proper to
suggest, that Congress might take any measures they
should judge necessary to prevent uneasiness arising
therefrom to the troops of these United States, who
might receive their pay in a different manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span></p>

<p>That to prevent loss happening to any of the citizens
of these United States, from receiving from the
troops of his Most Christian Majesty any small coins
they may be possessed of that shall be below the
standard alloy, the same will be exchanged for other
coins by persons that shall receive orders therefor.</p>

<p>The Minister desired to be informed of the mode of
intelligence Congress would rely on to give them immediate
notice of the arrival of the forces from France,
and for keeping up a constant communication after
their arrival, and again repeated his wishes that nothing
might be left unprovided for, that could promise
despatch to their operations and render them most extensively
useful to these United States.</p>

<p>The Minister also wished to recommend to the consideration
of Congress M. Louis Ethis de Corney,
Provincial Commissary of the troops in the service of
his Most Christian Majesty, for the honor of a brevet
commission of Lieutenant Colonel, which title his office
had given him in the French service. M. de
Corney desired not command or pay, but was ambitious
to deserve a mark of honor from these United
States, from which benefits might result to him hereafter.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<p>Upon the foregoing information your committee beg
leave to submit to the consideration of Congress the
following resolutions,</p>

<p>That a brevet commission of Lieutenant Colonel be
granted to M. Louis Ethis de Corney.</p>

<p>That M. de Corney be furnished with letters from
the President to the supreme executive powers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
several States, or to such of them as M. de Corney
shall apply for, requesting their advice and aid to him
in procuring provisions and other necessaries for the
forces of his Most Christian Majesty expected to arrive
in these United States, in such manner as will best
avoid a competition of purchases for the use above
mentioned, and those for the use of the troops of these
United States.</p>

<p>That the Minister of France be informed, that it is
the opinion of Congress, that the public service will
be best promoted by having the same currency made
use of, so far as may be, to procure supplies for the
forces of his Most Christian Majesty as for those of
these United States.</p>

<p>That the Governors of the States of Virginia and
Maryland be requested immediately to engage trusty
persons in those States respectively, at proper distances
from each other, on the main road from Cape
Henry in Virginia to Philadelphia, to hold themselves
in readiness, should the French fleet be discovered off
that Cape or the adjacent coast, to forward intelligence
thereof, and any despatches that may be received from
them to Congress, in the most expeditious manner.</p>

<div class="thought_break"></div>

<h3>REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS RESPECTING A
CONFERENCE WITH THE FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, June 7th, 1780.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to confer with the Minister of
France on the mode of obtaining supplies for the forces of
his Most Christian Majesty, and on other matters, report:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p>

<p>That the Minister of France has communicated to your
committee, that as M. de Corney, Commissary of the troops
of his Most Christian Majesty, will go into the State of
Connecticut to procure some supplies, it would be convenient
for him to receive there an advance of money
from these United States, either in Continental bills or the
bills of that State, to be replaced in specie on the arrival
of the fleet from France, and the Minister engages that
the moneys, which shall be so advanced by these United
States to M. de Corney, shall be replaced in specie as
above mentioned.</p>

<p>Upon which communication your committee beg leave
to submit to the consideration of Congress the following
resolution, viz.</p>

<p>That the Governor of the State of Connecticut be, and
he hereby is, authorised to receive on account of these
United States, out of the moneys raised by that State more
than sufficient to discharge the drafts heretofore made by
Congress, and to comply with the requisition of Congress
of the 20th of last month, or out of the bills that shall be
completed and lodged in the Continental Loan Office in
that State for the use of the United States, pursuant to a
resolution of Congress of the 18th of March last, one
million two hundred thousand dollars of the bills now in
circulation, or thirty thousand dollars of the bills last mentioned,
or a proportion of each, on the application of M.
de Corney, Commissary of the troops in the service of his
Most Christian Majesty, and advance the same to him,
taking his receipt therefor, to replace the same in specie in
the Treasury of these United States when required by
Congress; said receipts to be transmitted to the Treasury
Board as soon as may be.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, June 18th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned Minister of France has witnessed the
efforts of Congress to enable the Commander in Chief to
make a glorious commencement of the campaign; he is
convinced of the zeal with which all its members are animated,
and if the army has not hitherto received any of
the reinforcements announced in January last, he is persuaded
that Congress deeply lament those delays, and are
sincerely desirous to prevent the fatal consequences, which
might result from them. The undersigned has, since the
beginning of this year, continued to make the most pressing
representations on this subject, and all the answers
that he has received tend to assure him that the arrangements,
which were announced, would be carried into
full execution at the beginning of this month. Now that
the time fixed for putting the army on a respectable footing
has passed by, and it is but too certain, that the reinforcements
demanded four or five months ago have not yet
arrived, he earnestly entreats Congress to be pleased to
pay immediate attention to the supply of these troops, and
to the fulfilment of their promises.</p>

<p>The King, after the positive assurances, which he has
received, has not the least doubt, <i>that the American army
is now twentyfive thousand strong, not including commissioned
officers, and that it is, at this moment, in a condition
to undertake the most vigorous offensive operations
against the enemy in the posts, which he occupies within the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
<i>territory of the United States</i>. Congress, while giving
these assurances, expressed in an urgent manner the wish,
that a French squadron should facilitate the operations of
the land troops. The King has been eager to comply
with the requests of the Thirteen States. Their assurances
are the basis of the measures which his Majesty
has taken. A squadron is on the point of arrival, and the
French Generals expect to find forces, respectable in
numbers, ready to enter upon action. If, at the moment
of their arrival, they are deprived of the co-operation, upon
which they have reason to rely, the most precious time for
action will be lost; the enemy will have time to take the
necessary measures for defence, and, perhaps, to receive
reinforcements; the soldiers' ardor will be quenched in
inaction, and this delay will cause the loss of all the advantages
of a campaign, which, if conducted with suitable
promptness and activity, might have been made most useful
to the common cause, and perhaps decisive.</p>

<p>It being manifestly necessary to complete the army, the
undersigned has no doubt that Congress, as well from regard
to the public interest, as to its own glory and the performance
of its promises, will immediately take, for the
accomplishment of this object, measures more effectual
than those which have hitherto been taken. He hopes
also, that the proper arrangements will be made for constantly
maintaining, during the whole campaign, the number
which has been announced, and he takes the liberty of
recommending this important object in an equal degree to
the consideration of Congress.</p>

<p>The Minister of France, convinced of the zeal for the
public good, which inspires this Assembly, as well as of its
wisdom and prudence, hopes that it will see in his representations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
only a new proof of his attachment to the
common cause; that it will not be offended at the freedom,
with which he expresses himself upon so important a subject,
and that it will be pleased to put him in a situation
to transmit to his Court satisfactory details respecting the
fulfilment of the assurances made to him by Congress in
January last.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor
of informing Congress, that the Court of Madrid has sent
to Havana land and naval forces sufficient to make a
powerful diversion there. The Governor of Havana,
having been informed of the assurances given by this Assembly
on the 16th of December last, respecting the provisions
of which the islands and the fleet of his Catholic
Majesty might stand in need, is desirous that such quantities
of corn as shall not be necessary for the subsistence of
the armies destined to act upon this continent, may be successively
sent to him. It is desirable, that the quantity
now about to be sent should amount to three thousand
barrels, and, with the approbation of Congress, the undersigned
will give immediate orders to some merchants of
this city to make purchases in the States in such manner
as Congress shall think proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span></p>

<p>The Governor of Havana is also desirous of being supplied
with beef, and pork, suet, lard, and vegetables, and
with large and even small live cattle. The Minister of
France entreats Congress to be pleased to enable him to
send to Havana a favorable answer to these different demands,
and he will take pleasure in transmitting to the
Court of Madrid the intelligence of the facilities for supplies
of provision, which the Spanish Colonies shall have
enjoyed throughout the Thirteen States.</p>

<h3>CONGRESS TO THE MINISTER OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, July 7th, 1780.</p>

<p>The Minister of France having, in a note dated the
28th of June, informed Congress that the Court of Madrid
has sent to the Havana a considerable body of forces to
make a diversion in that quarter; and that the Governor
of Havana desires, that as much flour and fresh provisions,
such as cattle, hogs, suet, lard, and pulse, as can be
spared, should be sent thither; and the Minister having intimated,
that three thousand barrels of flour are immediately
wanted, and that he will undertake to have that
quantity purchased and sent, if Congress approve the
measure, the following answer was returned;</p>

<p>That the Minister of France be informed, that through
the loss of Charleston, the numerous army the States are
under the necessity of maintaining in the Southern department,
the ravages of the enemy, and the lightness of the
crops in the Middle States, as well as the present extraordinary
demand for the purposes of an effectual co-operation
with the expected armament of his Most Christian Majesty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
have not left these States in a situation to admit of
any considerable export of provisions; yet Congress, desirous
to testify their attention to the necessities of his
Catholic Majesty's Colonies and armaments, and as far as
lies in their power to compensate for the failure of supplies
of rice, which an alteration in the circumstances of
the Southern States has unhappily rendered it impracticable
to afford, have resolved, that it be recommended to
the State of Maryland to grant permission to such agent, as
the Minister of France shall appoint, to purchase within
that State any quantity of flour, not exceeding three thousand
barrels, and to ship the same to such Colonies of his
Catholic Majesty in the West Indies, as the Minister of
France may direct. That many of the articles mentioned
in this Memorial of the Minister being such as the Colonies
of his Catholic Majesty furnish upon better terms than
they can be procured from these States in their present
situation, it is to be presumed they will feel no inconvenience
from Congress' not entering at this time into any
determination thereon.</p>

<p>Resolved, That Congress will from time to time afford
such supplies to the Colonies of his Catholic Majesty, as
their circumstances may require, and the situation of these
States enable them to grant.</p>

Will you have the kindness, Sir, in imparting this news to

to propose putting these vessels under the orders of
M. de Ternay, commander of the French squadron, while

proposition, it will be necessary to send orders to the

<p class="letter_head">
Head Quarters, July 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency a letter,
which has just come to hand, from the Count de
Rochambeau, of the 22d instant. It is certainly of
great importance, that the precaution he mentions
should be taken without loss of time. I should think
the Delaware the best place for the reception of the
second division, though there ought to be cruisers off
both bays. It is necessary that a plan should be previously
fixed for the junction of the fleets after the
debarkation. I shall immediately write to the Count
for this purpose.</p>

<p>We have repeated accounts from New York, that
General Clinton is making a large detachment for a
combined attack upon the French fleet and army. This
will be a hazardous attempt, and, therefore, though I
do not regard it as impossible, I do not give it entire
faith. The Count de Rochambeau has been some time
since apprized of these demonstrations, and seems to
have been preparing for what might happen.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of
respect and attachment, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I enclose to your Excellency a letter for M. de
Ternay, in which you will see what measures I have
taken to fulfil the intentions, which you imparted to
me on the 27th instant. I beg you will seal this packet
and send it to his address by the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Congress have put under your orders the frigates, in
directing them to come into the Delaware. You will
be able to judge, after your arrangements with the
Chevalier de Ternay, whether these vessels, or one of
them, may not accomplish the commission desired.
Their cruise may then be useful to the commerce of
the United States. I know not whether M. de Ternay
will communicate to them any signals, by means
of which they may approach the coast without danger.
Your Excellency may be able, should you think it
necessary, to suggest it to him.</p>

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Peekskill, August 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Colonel Jamet arrived here last night, by whom I
had the honor to receive your Excellency's request,
that I would send instructions for the second division
coming from France, with respect to the measures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
which it should pursue for forming a junction with the
first. I beg leave to inform your Excellency, that I
wrote to the Count de Rochambeau, agreeably to my
letter to you of the 27th ultimo, and requested that he,
in concert with the Chevalier de Ternay, would communicate
to me, that it might be transmitted to your
Excellency, the line of conduct which they should
judge proper to be pursued by this division.</p>

<p>As the Marine are concerned, and the junction in
present circumstances is a matter of peculiar delicacy,
I did not think myself qualified to decide on the point.
I have not received their answer yet, and therefore I
cannot pretend to determine what should be done; I
will, however, take the liberty to observe, that if the
ships of war with this division are superior, or even
fully equal to those of the enemy, off Rhode Island, I
should suppose it would be eligible for them to proceed
there at once, should they be met by the cruisers your
Excellency has sent out on the Southern coast. If this
is not the case, they ought to make the Delaware as
soon as possible. In this event the troops might be
forwarded to Trenton in the first instance, and the
ships might remain until ulterior measures, with respect
to them, should be determined. These, however, I
would not offer but as mere suggestions, and much it
would seem must depend on circumstances and the
discretion of the officer commanding the division.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the ships of war should proceed directly
to Rhode Island, it will be best for them to disembarrass
themselves of their transports, and send them into
the Delaware as in the other case. I take it for
granted, that signals of recognisance have been preconcerted
between the two divisions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span></p>

<p>On the 31st ultimo, the enemy's fleet in the Sound
returned from Huntington Bay to New York. From
every information the Count de Rochambeau and his
army were certainly their object, and they had embarked
in considerable force, with a view of attacking
him. I cannot determine with precision the reasons,
which induced the enemy to relinquish their plan; but
it is not improbable that the movements of our army,
and the ulterior measures I was about to prosecute,
operated in some measure to produce it.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I had this morning the honor to receive your Excellency's
letter of the 30th of July, with the one addressed
to the Chevalier de Ternay, which I have
sealed and forwarded by an express.</p>

<p>With respect to the Continental frigates, I beg leave
to inform your Excellency, that I did not apprehend,
from the resolution of Congress concerning them, that
they were to be under my orders, or to receive any
instructions from me, until they had joined the Chevalier
de Ternay, after assembling in the Delaware.
This being the case, I cannot give any directions about
them at present, and would take the liberty to recommend
to your Excellency to apply to Congress or the
Board of Admiralty; to the latter of whom I have
written to give their orders to the captains of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
frigates, on the conduct they are to pursue. The employment
for them, or at least for one which your
Excellency has suggested, appears to me to be proper,
and that it will answer the double purposes you
mention.</p>

<p>I have, by my letter of today to the Chevalier de
Ternay, requested him to advise me in what manner
he thinks the frigates can be most usefully employed
to assist his fleet, and that there might be no further
delay, when matters with respect to them are ultimately
fixed, I requested him also to communicate to
the Captains of the frigates at Boston, as well as to
myself, the signals of recognisance.</p>

<p>When I receive his answer I will embrace the earliest
occasion to transmit the signals.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose you a letter, which upon the
whole I have thought it advisable to write to the Count
de Guichen. As its contents are of a nature to make its
falling into the enemy's hands in its present form dangerous,
and as I have no cypher of communication with the
Count, I take the liberty to request your Excellency's assistance,
in making use of yours, and forwarding it by
triplicates with your despatches by the first opportunities.</p>

<p>I make no mention of a land force, because though it
would be useful, it may be dispensed with. But if a body
of troops could conveniently accompany the fleets, it would
give greater energy and certainty of success to our operations.
I am the more induced to desire it, as the composition
of a considerable part of our army is temporary,
and I am not informed what measures may be taken to
replace the men whose times of service will expire.</p>

<p>I need use no arguments to convince your Excellency
of the extremity, to which our affairs are tending, and the

<h3>FROM CONGRESS TO THE KING OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p>The United States of America in Congress assembled,
to their Great, Faithful and Beloved Friend and
Ally, Louis the Sixteenth, King of France and
Navarre.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Great, Faithful and Beloved Friend and Ally,</p>

<p>Persuaded of your Majesty's friendship, and of your
earnest desire to prosecute the war with glory and
advantage to the alliance, we ought not to conceal
from your Majesty the embarrassments, which have
attended our national affairs, and rendered the last
campaign unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A naval superiority in the American seas having
enabled the enemy, in the midst of the last winter, to
divide their army, and extend the war in the Southern
States, Charleston was subdued before a sufficient force
could be assembled for its relief.</p>

<p>With unabated ardor, and at a vast expense, we prepared
for the succeeding campaign; a campaign from
which, in a dependence on the co-operation of the
squadron and troops generously destined by your Majesty
for our assistance, we had formed the highest
expectations. Again the enemy frustrated our measures.
Your Majesty's succors were confined within
the harbor of Newport, while the main body of the
British army took refuge in their fortresses, and under
protection of their marine, declining to hazard a battle
in the open field; and regardless of their rank among
civilized nations, they descended to wage a predatory
war. Britons and savages united in sudden irruptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
on our northern and western frontiers, and marked
their progress with blood and desolation.</p>

<p>The acquisition of Charleston, with the advantages
gained in Georgia, and the defeat of a small army
composed chiefly of militia, which had been hastily
collected to check their operations, encouraged the
British commander in that quarter to penetrate through
South Carolina into the interior parts of North Carolina.
And the ordinary calamities of war were embittered
by implacable vengeance. They did not, however,
long enjoy their triumph. Instead of being
depressed, impending danger served only to rouse our
citizens to correspondent exertions; and by a series of
gallant and successful enterprises they compelled the
enemy to retreat with precipitation and disgrace.</p>

<p>They seem, however, resolved by all possible efforts,
not only to retain their posts in Georgia and South
Carolina, but to renew their attempts on North Carolina.
To divert the reinforcements destined for those
States, they are now executing an enterprise against
the seacoast of Virginia; and from their preparations
at New York and intelligence from Europe, it is manifest
that the four southern States will now become a
principal object of their hostilities.</p>

<p>It is the voice of the people and the resolution of
Congress to prosecute the war with redoubled vigor,
and to draw into the field a permanent and well appointed
army of thirtyfive thousand regular troops.
By this decisive effort we trust that we shall be able,
under the divine blessing, so effectually to co-operate
with your Majesty's marine and land forces, as to
expel the common enemy from our country, and render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
the great object of the alliance perpetual. But to
accomplish an enterprise of such magnitude, and so
interesting to both nations, whatever may be our spirit
and our exertions, we know that our internal resources
must prove incompetent. The sincerity of this declaration
will be manifest from a short review of our
circumstances.</p>

<p>Unpractised in military arts, and unprepared with the
means of defence, we were suddenly invaded by a formidable
and vindictive nation. We supported the unequal
conflict for years with very little foreign aid, but what was
derived from your Majesty's generous friendship. Exertions
uncommon, even among the most wealthy and best
established governments, necessarily exhausted our finances,
plunged us into debt, and anticipated our taxes; while the
depredations of an active enemy by sea and land made
deep impressions on our commerce and our productions.
Thus encompassed with difficulties, in our representation to
your Majesty of June 15, 1779, we disclosed our wants,
and requested your Majesty to furnish us with clothing,
arms, and ammunition for the last campaign, on the credit
of the United States. We entertain a lively sense of your
Majesty's friendly disposition, in enabling our Minister to
procure a part of those supplies, of which, through unfortunate
events, a very small proportion has arrived. The
sufferings of our army from this disappointment have been
so severe, that we must rely on your Majesty's attention to
our welfare for effectual assistance. The articles of the
estimate transmitted to our Minister are essential to our
army, and we flatter ourselves, that through your Majesty's
interposition they will be supplied.</p>

<p>At a time when we feel ourselves strongly impressed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
the weight of past obligations, it is with the utmost reluctance
that we yield to the emergency of our affairs in
requesting additional favors. An unreserved confidence in
your Majesty, and a well grounded assurance, that we ask
no more than is necessary to enable us effectually to co-operate
with your Majesty, in terminating the war with
glory and success, must be our justification.</p>

<p>It is well known, that when the King of Great Britain
found himself unable to subdue the populous States of
North America by force, or to seduce them by art to
relinquish the alliance with your Majesty, he resolved to
protract the war, in expectation that the loss of our commerce,
and the derangement of our finances, must eventually
compel us to submit to his domination. Apprized of
the necessity of foreign aids of money to support us in a
contest with a nation so rich and powerful, we have long
since authorised our Minister to borrow a sufficient sum in
your Majesty's dominions, and in Spain, and in Holland,
on the credit of these United States.</p>

<p>We now view the prospect of a disappointment with the
deeper concern, as the late misfortunes in the southern
States, and the ravages of the northern and western frontiers,
have, in a very considerable degree, impaired our internal
resources. From a full investigation of our circumstances
it is manifest, that in aid of our utmost exertions a foreign
loan of specie, at least to the amount of twentyfive millions
of livres, will be indispensably necessary for a vigorous
prosecution of the war. On an occasion, in which the
independence of these United States and your Majesty's
glory are so intimately connected, we are constrained to
request your Majesty effectually to support the applications
of our Ministers for that loan. So essential is it to the

Philadelphia, December 5th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I flattered myself, that the clothing destined for the army
under the command of your Excellency had at length
arrived in the river, in the vessel of Paul Jones, or in one
of those coming under his convoy; but I regret that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
have not yet had that satisfaction. A passenger, who
arrived in one of this convoy, told me, that when this little
squadron, which left France on the 8th of October, should
arrive, they would bring but little clothing, being in great
part laden with arms and ammunition; but he added, that
the Serapis is destined to bring the remainder of the
clothing, and that we may hope to see the vessel arrive
soon in our ports. I am anxious to have an opportunity
of giving your Excellency notice of the arrival of these
articles.</p>

<p>I have received certain intelligence, that an expedition
composed of four thousand troops, convoyed by eight vessels
of war, departed on the 16th of October from the
Havana to attempt an expedition against Pensacola. But
it is thought that the terrible tempests, which they may
have received on the passage, may have retarded the fleet.</p>

<p>Another expedition was to depart in the month of December
to attack St Augustine. It was to be composed
of ten thousand men, regulars and militia, and twelve vessels
of war. I wish sincerely that the operation may meet
with success, and thus make an advantageous diversion in
favor of the United States in that quarter.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de Chastellux, and the officers who had
the honor of visiting you at head quarters, desire me to
present their respects to you. They hope to have the
honor of seeing you again on their return.</p>

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">New Windsor, December 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Yesterday brought me the honor of your Excellency's
favor without date; but which I suppose to have been
written on the 5th instant, as it accompanied a letter from
the Marquis de Lafayette of that date.</p>

<p>Receive, my good Sir, the expressions of gratitude,
which are due to your Excellency for the important intelligence
you have communicated, relative to the designs of
the Spanish Court upon the Floridas. I have transmitted
the account of these interesting events to Count de Rochambeau,
and the Chevalier de Ternay, with propositions,
which, if acceded to, I shall do myself the honor of
communicating to your Excellency.</p>

<p>It would have been fortunate for the army, if your Excellency's
feelings for its want of clothing could have been
relieved by the agreeable tidings of the arrival of that article;
but, alas! we are so accustomed to want, that we dare
not flatter ourselves with relief.</p>

<p>Your Excellency's despatches for Rhode Island, accompanying
your letter to me, came to hand at the instant the
post was setting out, and were committed to his care. It
is the only means of conveyance now left me, since the
chain of expresses formed by the dragoon horses, which
were worn down and sent to their cantonment, have been
discontinued. The Quarter Master General has it not in
his power, for want of money, to furnish an express upon
the most urgent occasion.</p>

<p>I anticipate with much pleasure the visit I shall receive
from the Chevalier de Chastellux and the other gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>

beg the favor of your Excellency to present my compliments
to them and to M. de Marbois.</p>

<h3>M. DESTOUCHES TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
On Board the Duc de Bourgogne,<br />
March 19th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The enemy, informed without doubt, in some manner,
arrived at the same time with myself at the Capes of Chesapeake
Bay, and it would have been impracticable to attempt
to disembark the troops, even from the vessels of
war, in spite of the English squadron and under its fire.
Obliged to renounce, for a time at least, the hope of rendering
assistance to the State of Virginia, I have been employed
only with the care of preserving the honor of his
Majesty's arms, and I flatter myself that it has not suffered
in my battle with the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 16th instant, in consequence of a violent south
wind, which had carried the squadron to the northeast,
we discovered, at break of day, a frigate two gun-shots to
windward. A short time after, we perceived several large
vessels in rear of the squadron. I had then no doubt that
this was the English squadron, which, being informed of
my project, had arrived, almost at the same time, upon the
coast of Virginia. I immediately made a signal to the
squadron to form in line of battle, the English squadron
being about two leagues to the south, and running on the
same tack with me. At nine o'clock, I tacked, and the
enemy did the same. Before one o'clock, afternoon, their
vanguard was not more than half a league distant from the
rear of my line. Till that time, I had man&oelig;uvered without
avoiding or seeking an engagement, because I perceived,
that even the greatest success, with which I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
flatter myself, would still render it impossible for me to
fulfil my object; but the determined design, which was
shown by the enemy of attacking my rearguard, and the
honor of the royal arms, which I had to sustain, made me
resolve to go and meet him. At one o'clock the firing
commenced on both sides; the head of the English line
had borne down, and the van of my squadron had done
the same, so that the two squadrons fought for some time
while running before the wind. A little before two o'clock,
I determined to make the squadron haul nearer the wind,
a movement, which made the whole squadron file before
the head of the enemy's line.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre completely succeeded; their leading
ship had hardly felt the fire of the fifth vessel, when she
retired from the engagement, under the escort of a frigate,
which came to her assistance. The rear of the English
squadron had still continued the combat with my rearguard,
but that part of my squadron has sustained little injury.
At a quarter before three o'clock, the firing ceased on
both sides. The English squadron being in the rear, and
to windward of mine, I made a signal to form again in
order of battle, which was done in a short time. I then
designed to turn again upon the enemy, who appeared to
have sustained more injury than my own squadron; but
the signals, which were made by the ships <i>le Conquerant</i>
and <i>l'Ardent</i>, informed me that these vessels, and particularly
the former, had been considerably injured in the
engagement. I then continued to run on the same tack,
under easy sail, ready to receive the enemy, if he should
think proper to risk a second encounter, but he prudently
kept in the rear and to windward during the remainder
of the day, without availing himself of the superior advantages
of his situation for renewing the engagement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span></p>

<p>When night came on, the English squadron bore up,
and I continued to run to the southeast. On the next
morning, I assembled the captains to know the state of
their vessels. I found that the rudder and all the masts of
the ship, <i>le Conquerant</i>, were in the most dangerous state,
and that the mainmast of <i>l'Ardent</i> was very much injured;
and also that several other vessels had received
cannon-shots in their lower masts; it was, consequently,
determined that the squadron should return directly to
Newport to repair.</p>

<p>I cannot too highly praise the courageous boldness,
which was shown by the captains, officers, and crews of
my squadron, as well as by the troops, embarked as passengers.
Their valor made my force equal to that of the
English squadron, which had one vessel more than mine,
and if it had been only necessary to the success of our expedition
to give the enemy another check, I should have
regarded it as certain, notwithstanding the superiority of
their forces.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, March 24th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of France
has the honor to inform Congress, that the King, being
made acquainted with the situation of the affairs of the
confederacy, had resolved to continue during the next campaign
the land and sea forces, which are now in this Continent.
That unforeseen obstacles had prevented the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
junction of the second division of sea forces with the first
as soon as was expected, but that it was to sail as soon as
possible, and that Congress should use their utmost exertions
to have their army ready for action without the least
delay.</p>

<p>But while the King, actuated by his love for the United
States, of his mere motion was giving them succors, which
he was under no obligation to do, and out of regard to them
lessened the efforts, which he could have made for his own
advantage, he had reason to expect a proportionable activity
from Congress, and he hopes that the United States, which
have so much to gain or lose by the issue of the contest,
will employ all their resources in the present conjuncture;
and that the Congress, who are intrusted with their dearest
interest, will hasten to adopt effectual measures for conducting
matters to a happy issue.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de la Luzerne, when he communicated
to the King the news of the final ratification of the confederation,
thought himself warranted to assure his Majesty,
that this event would have a happy influence on the councils
of this Republic; that they would thereby acquire all
the energy necessary for conducting the important business
intrusted to them; that the Union would receive new
force, and he did not doubt but the ensuing campaign
would give decisive proofs of this. And the Minister relies
that his hopes, which are the same as are entertained by
the whole continent, will not be disappointed. It is at the
same time essential, while Congress are making the necessary
arrangements for the ensuing campaign, that they
should know for certain that they are to count only on their
own resources for defraying the expenses that it will
require.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<p>The frankness of the King, and the friendship he bears
to the United States, will not permit him to encourage an
error, which they appear to be in, with respect to the pecuniary
aids, which they seem to expect. The desire of
securing their independence had induced his Majesty to
exceed the measure of the engagements he had contracted
with them, and he will continue to support their interests,
either by powerful diversions or by immediate succors, and
they may rely not only on his most scrupulous punctuality
in the execution of his engagements, but upon all the extraordinary
assistance, which it will be in his power to give
them. But as to pecuniary aids, the enormous expenses
of the present war, and the necessity of preserving credit,
which is the only means of providing for those expenses,
do not permit his Majesty's Ministers to give Congress the
least hope in that respect.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de la Luzerne will not dissemble, that his
Court was exceedingly surprised on being informed of the
step, which Congress had taken in disposing of bills drawn
on their Minister, although they could not be ignorant that
they had no funds for discharging them. This is a conduct
totally inconsistent with that order, which his Majesty
is forced to observe in his finances, and he has no doubt
but in future Congress will most studiously avoid a repetition
of it. He has, nevertheless, resolved to discharge the
bills, which became due last year, to the amount of one
million of livres; and it is probable his Majesty will be
able to provide funds to the amount of three millions for
the discharge of those, which will become due in the course
of the present year.</p>

<p>The King's Ministers have also procured for Dr Franklin,
whose zeal, wisdom and patriotism, deserve their utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
confidence, the sums necessary for the purchase he is
ordered to make. These expenses, joined to those occasioned
by sending a fleet and army to this continent, far
exceed what Congress had a right to expect from the
friendship of their ally, and the Chevalier de la Luzerne is
persuaded, that from this moment Congress will abstain
from that ruinous measure of drawing bills of exchange
without the previous knowledge and consent of his Majesty's
Ministers. And as their attention is employed in
what may be most for the convenience of the United States,
they propose that Congress should furnish the fleet and
army of his Majesty, which are in this country, with the
necessary provisions, and receive in payment bills on the
treasury of France, which will be punctually discharged.</p>

<p>As to the manner in which this arrangement may be
made, the Minister will have the honor of entering into a
minute discussion with a committee, which he begs Congress
would be pleased to appoint to confer with him on
the subject.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 7th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The accounts from Virginia and the other southern
States leave no doubt but the English are resolved to
attack them in very superior forces. They are already
in a condition to command them by the advantage,
which they have of transporting themselves by the sea
and by all the rivers, as it suits them. Virginia, one
of the most powerful States in the Union, finds herself
by these means reduced to a state of inaction, and as
the Bay of Chesapeake is entirely in the possession of
the enemy, it is to be feared that Maryland will find
herself shortly in the same condition and in the same
danger. It is manifest, that the plan of the English is
to harass and desolate them without intermission, to
inspire part of the inhabitants with a desire of seeing
an end of the quarrel, and when they think their
weariness and their calamities are at the height, to
make them propositions advantageous enough to withdraw
them from the Confederation.</p>

<p>Although these States are firmly attached to their
independence, it has in the meantime become very
important to make them participate as much as it is
possible in the assistance, which his Majesty has
granted to his allies, and I can assure you, Sir, that you
cannot in present circumstances render them a greater
service, than by entering the Bay of Chesapeake, and
endeavoring to establish yourself there.</p>

<p>Many other political considerations, into the details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
of which I shall not enter, press that measure, and if it
be possible for you to carry it into execution, I have
reason to believe that you will entirely disconcert the
enemy's plans against Virginia and Maryland, and when
you shall have given to those two States the liberty
of exerting themselves, you will contribute very much
at the same time to the relief of the more southern, by
the assistance which they will be capable of affording.
Your position in the Bay of Chesapeake will restrain
also their communication between New York and
Charleston, and perhaps prevent other events, which
may be yet more grievous to the invaded States.</p>

<p>In giving, Sir, my opinion upon the utility of the
movement, I avow to you that I am totally incapable
of forming one as to the possibility of carrying it into
execution. I have had the honor of transmitting to
you from time to time the details and plans, which can
enable you to form a judgment. M. de Tilly having
been better situated during his stay in Hampton Roads
to make the necessary observations, you can decide
by them. I pray you also to regard my entreaties,
although pressing as the circumstances render them,
as entirely subordinate to the instructions, which you
may have received from the Court.</p>

<p>I do not propose to you to change your position,
only upon a supposition that you have no orders to the
contrary, and that you have received no other destination.</p>

<p>As to the measures you are in this case to expect
from the States, which you will go to assist, I beg you
to assure yourself, Sir, that they will spare nothing to
satisfy you, and if an assemblage of land forces is

Philadelphia, May 9th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>Congress has been pleased, by a resolution, dated the
10th of November last, to take the measures suggested by
the undersigned Minister of France, concerning the abuse
by the English, of the papers, letters of marque, and commissions,
which they find on board of the American
vessels, of which they succeed in gaining possession. The
Governors of our Islands observe, that the precautions
pointed out in the resolution of Congress are insufficient,
unless, independently of the vessels and ships of war, they
extend to merchant vessels, and, in general, to all ships
sailing from this continent. The similarity of language
enables the English to gain admission into our Islands
with great facility, by means of intercepted papers, and to
send their spies and emissaries into the very middle of our
ports, where their presence may be most dangerous.</p>

<p>The said Governors remark, that the greater part of the
vessels, which arrive at the Islands, do not conform to the
resolutions of Congress; and, although they carry letters
of marque, yet they do not take the precautions required
by them. The undersigned requests, that this Assembly
would be pleased to consider these observations, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
adopt, on this subject, such measures as shall seem best
adapted to prevent the abuses in question.</p>

<p>The commanding officer of St Domingo is also desirous,
that Congress should be informed that the commanders of
the American frigates have, while stationed at the Cape,
given strong proofs of zeal for the common cause, whether
in cruising against the enemy, or in convoying, at their
departure, merchant vessels sailing from that Colony.</p>

<p>We have received your letter of the 22d of November

We have seen with pain, the picture of the embarrassment

it, that we have resolved to assist you as much as our own
necessities, and the extraordinary and very great expenses
required on our part by the war, which we are carrying
on for your defence, will permit. We have ordered the
Chevalier de la Luzerne to acquaint you more particularly
with our intentions. We are already convinced, that the
details into which he shall enter, will induce you to make
the greatest efforts to second our own, and that you will
be more and more convinced by them, that we take the
most sincere interest in the cause of the United States, and
that we are employing every means in our power to ensure
their final triumph. You may rely upon our perseverance
in the principles, which have hitherto directed our conduct;
it is exerted upon all occasions; as well as upon

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Weathersfield, May 23d, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The letter, which I have the honor to enclose from the
Count de Rochambeau, will, I imagine, inform your Excellency
of the intended march of the French army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
towards the North River, and of the destination of the
King's squadron now in the harbor of Newport, if circumstances
will admit of the respective movements. I should
be wanting in respect and confidence, were I not to add,
that our object is New York.</p>

<p>The season, the difficulty and expense of land transportation,
and the continual waste of men in every attempt to
reinforce the Southern States, are almost insuperable objections
to marching another detachment from the army
on the North River; nor do I see how it is possible to
give effectual support to those States, and avert the evils
which threaten them, while we are inferior in naval force
in these seas. It is not for me to know in what manner
the fleet of his Most Christian Majesty is to be employed
in the West Indies this summer, or to inquire at what
epoch it may be expected on this coast; but the appearance
and aid of it in this quarter are of such essential importance
in any offensive operation, and so necessary to
stop the progress of the enemy's arms, that I shall be excused,
I am persuaded, for endeavoring to engage your
Excellency's good offices in facilitating an event on which
so much depends. For this I have a stronger plea, when
I assure you that General Rochambeau's opinion and
wishes concur with mine, and that it is at his instance
principally that I make you this address.</p>

<p>If we are happy enough to find your Excellency in sentiment
with us, it will be in your power to inform the
Count de Grasse of the strength and situation of the
enemy's naval and land force in this country; the destination
of the French squadron under Admiral Barras and the
intention of the allied arms, if a junction can be formed.
At present, the British fleet lies within Block Island, and
about five leagues from Point Judith.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span></p>

<p>The Count de Rochambeau and the Chevalier Chastellux
agree perfectly in sentiment with me, that, while affairs
remain as they now are, the West India fleet should run
immediately to Sandy Hook, if there are no concerted
operations, where they may be met, with all the information
requisite, and where, most likely, it will shut in, or cut
off Admiral Arbuthnot, and may be joined by the Count
de Barras. An early and frequent communication from
the Count de Grasse would lead to preparatory measures
on our part, and be a means of facilitating the operation
in hand, or any other which may be thought more
advisable.</p>

<p>I know your Excellency's goodness, and your zeal for
the common cause too well, to offer anything more as an
apology for this liberty; and I persuade myself it is unnecessary
for me to declare the respect and attachment,
with which I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 25th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary of France has
the honor of informing Congress, that it has been found
impossible to send the second division of the troops under
the command of Count de Rochambeau, and of the
French squadron designed for the defence of the coasts of
the Thirteen States, and that it can no longer be expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
during the course of this campaign. The necessary
measures have, however, been taken for increasing the
body of troops now at Rhode Island, and, by sending some
vessels of force, for putting the squadron into a condition
to enter again upon active service.</p>

<p>The undersigned requests Congress to be pleased to
appoint a committee, to whom he will communicate the
causes which have occasioned this change; and Congress
will find in them new proofs of the wisdom of the motives,
which direct the conduct of his Majesty. But if considerations
of the greatest importance deprive him of the satisfaction
of assisting the Thirteen United States in their own
country, by sending a number of vessels and of auxiliaries,
as considerable as he had proposed, he will make no less
vigorous efforts against the enemy; and he hopes that
these powerful diversions will prevent the enemy from
forming any enterprise, to which the resources and the
courage of the Thirteen States shall be unequal.</p>

<p>The King has, at the same time, resolved to give a new
proof of his affection and of his earnest desire to afford a
remedy for the difficulties, which they experience in procuring
the funds necessary for acting with vigor and effect
during the present campaign. With this view, the King,
notwithstanding the immense expense at which he is
obliged to support the war in which he is engaged, has resolved
to dispose of a considerable fund, which shall be
appropriated to the purchase of clothing, arms, and stores,
for which Dr Franklin has been instructed to ask. The
Count de Vergennes will concert measures on this subject
with the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States, Dr.
Franklin; and M. Necker proposes to take the proper
precautions, in order that the merchandise may be of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
good and sound quality, and at a price answering to its
exact value.</p>

<p>The subsidy which the King has resolved to grant to the
Thirteen United States amounts to six millions of livres
tournois, independent of the four millions, which the Ministry
have enabled Dr Franklin to borrow for the service of
the current year. It is presumed, that this sum of six
millions will not be wholly applied to the purchase of the
articles asked for; and in that case, it is his Majesty's
intention that the surplus should be reserved, that it may
be at the disposal of Congress, or of the Superintendent of
the finances of the Thirteen States, if they think proper to
confide the management of it to him. It has not been possible
for the Court, by reason of the speedy departure of
the vessel which brought this intelligence to the undersigned
Minister, to determine what will be the amount of the sums
of money remaining after the purchase of the above mentioned
articles, but lest there should seem to be any delay
in supplying the wants of the Thirteen States, the Chevalier
de la Luzerne takes it upon himself, without waiting
for any further orders, to fix the amount of these sums at
fifteen hundred thousand livres tournois, and if Congress,
in fact, think that they shall need this whole sum, he will
without delay inform his Court of it, in order that the necessary
measures may be taken for discharging the bills of
exchange, which shall consequently be drawn. As it is the
intention of the King, that the greatest regularity shall take
place in the payments, it will be well for the undersigned
to agree with Congress, or with the Superintendent of
Finance, and fix upon the times at which these bills shall
be negotiated, and upon those at which they shall be payable.
It is necessary that these times of payment should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
be at sufficient distances from each other, so that the
department of finance may not be obliged to pay considerable
sums in too short intervals of time.</p>

<p>The intention of the King, in granting to the Thirteen
States this purely gratuitous subsidy, is to put them in a
condition to act vigorously during this campaign; and his
Majesty is desirous that Congress would be pleased to give
the necessary orders, that it may be entirely applied to this
important object, which admits of no delay. The communications,
which the undersigned is instructed to make
to Congress, will convince that body of the necessity of
losing no time.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="translation">Translation.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 26th, 1781.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>The underwritten, Minister Plenipotentiary of France,
has received orders to communicate to Congress some
important details touching the present situation of sundry
affairs, in which the United States are immediately interested.
The most essential are in regard to some overtures,
which announce on the part of Great Britain a desire
of peace. The Empress of Russia having invited the King
and the Court of London to accept her mediation, the
latter Court considered this as a formal offer and accepted
it. This Court appeared at the same time to desire the
Emperor of Austria to take part therein; and this
Monarch has in fact proposed his co-mediation to the
belligerent powers in Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span></p>

<p>The King could not but congratulate himself on seeing
so important a negotiation in the hands of two mediators,
whose understanding and justice are equal. Nevertheless,
his Majesty, actuated by his affections for the United
States, returned for answer, that it was not in his power
to accept the offers made to him, and that the consent of
his allies was necessary. The King wishes to have this
consent before he formally accepts the proposed mediation.
But it is possible that circumstances joined to the confidence
he has in the mediators, and the justice of his cause,
and that of the United States, his allies, may determine him
to enter upon a negotiation before the answer of Congress
can reach him.</p>

<p>But in either case, it is of great importance, that this
Assembly should give their Plenipotentiary instructions
proper to announce their disposition to peace, and their
moderation, and to convince the powers of Europe, that
the independence of the Thirteen United States, and the
engagements they have contracted with the King, are the
sole motives, which determine them to continue the war;
and that whenever they shall have full and satisfactory
assurances on these two capital points, they will be ready
to conclude a peace. The manner of conducting the negotiation,
the extent of the powers of the American Plenipotentiary,
the use to be made of them, and the confidence
that ought to be reposed in the French Plenipotentiaries
and the King's Ministers, are points, which should be fully
discussed with a committee.</p>

<p>And the underwritten Minister entreats, that Congress
would be pleased to name a committee with whom he will
have the honor to treat. He thinks that this Assembly
will be sensible, that the King could not give a greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
mark of his affection for the Thirteen United States, or of
his attachment to the principles of the alliance, than by
determining not to enter upon a negotiation before they
were ready to take part therein, although in other respects,
his confidence in the mediators, and the relation he stands
in to one of them, were sufficient motives to induce him
to accept their offers. Congress are too sensible of the
uncertainty of negotiations of this sort not to know, that
the moment of opening them is that precisely when the
efforts against the enemy ought to be redoubled; and that
nothing can facilitate the operation of the negotiators
so much as the success of the arms of the allies; that
a check would be productive of disagreeable consequences
to both, and that the enemy would rise in their pretensions,
their haughtiness, and obstinacy, in proportion to the languor
and slackness of the confederates.</p>

<p>The undersigned will have the honor to communicate
to the committee some circumstances relative to the sending
Mr Cumberland to Madrid; to the use, which Mr
Adams thought he was authorised to make of his Plenipotentiary
powers; to the mission of Mr Dana; to the association
of the neutral powers; and to the present state of
affairs in the south. Congress will find new motives for
relying on the good will of the King, and on the interest he
takes in favor of the United States in general, and of each
one of them in particular.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF A CONFERENCE WITH THE FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, May 28th, 1781.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to confer with the Minister of
France, report,</p>

<p>That the Minister communicated some parts of a
despatch, which he had received from the Count de Vergennes,
dated the 9th of March, 1781. That the resolves
of Congress, which had been adopted on the association of
the neutral powers, were found very wise by the Council
of the King, and that it was thought they might be of
service in the course of the negotiation. The French
Ministry did not doubt but they would be very agreeable to
the Empress of Russia. But they were not of the same
opinion with respect to the appointment of Mr Dana, as a
Minister to the Court of Petersburg. The reason is, that
Catharine the Second has made it a point until now to
profess the greatest impartiality between the belligerent
powers. The conduct she pursues on this occasion is a
consequence of the expectation she has, that peace maybe
re-established by her mediation; therefore, she could by
no means take any step, which might show on her side the
least propension in favor of the Americans, and expose her
to the suspicion of partiality towards America, and of course
exclude her from the mediation. The appointment of Mr
Dana, therefore, appears to be at least premature, and the
opinion of the Council is, that this deputy ought not to
make any use of his powers at this moment. In case he
applies to the Count de Vergennes for advice, he shall be
desired to delay making any use of his powers. The
Count observes, it would be disagreeable to Congress that
their Plenipotentiary should meet with a refusal, that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
dignity would be offended, and that such a satisfaction
ought not to be given to the Court of London, especially
when negotiations of a greater moment are about to commence.
However, the French Minister had orders to
assure the committee, that his Court would use all their
endeavors in proper time, to facilitate the admissions of the
Plenipotentiary of Congress.</p>

<p>The Minister communicated to the committee several
observations respecting the conduct of Mr Adams; and in
doing justice to his patriotic character, he gave notice to
the committee, of several circumstances, which proved it
necessary that Congress should draw a line of conduct to
that Minister, of which he might not be allowed to lose
sight. The Minister dwelt especially on a circumstance
already known to Congress, namely, the use which Mr
Adams thought he had a right to make of his powers to
treat with Great Britain. The Minister concluded on this
subject, that if Congress put any confidence in the King's
friendship and benevolence; if they were persuaded of his
inviolable attachment to the principle of the alliance, and
of his firm resolution constantly to support the cause of the
United States, they would be impressed with the necessity
of prescribing to their Plenipotentiary a perfect and open
confidence in the French Ministers, and a thorough reliance
on the King, and would direct him to take no step without
the approbation of his Majesty; and after giving him, in his
instructions, the principal and most important outlines for
his conduct, they would order him, with respect to the
manner of carrying them into execution, to receive his
directions from the Count de Vergennes, or from the person
who might be charged with the negotiation in the name
of the King.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span></p>

<p>The Minister observed, that this matter is the more
important, because, being allied with the United States, it
is the business of the King to support their cause with those
powers with whom Congress have no connexion, and can
have none, until their independence is in a fair train to be
acknowledged. That the King would make it a point of
prudence and justice to support the Minister of Congress;
but in case this Minister, by aiming at impossible things,
forming exorbitant demands, which disinterested mediators
might think ill-founded, or perhaps by misconstruing
his instructions, should put the French negotiators under
the necessity of proceeding in the course of the negotiation
without a constant connexion with him, this would give rise
to an unbecoming contradiction between France and the
Thirteen United States, which could not but be of very
bad effect in the course of the negotiation.</p>

<p>In making these observations, the Minister remarked,
that it was always to be taken for granted, that the most
perfect independency is to be the foundation of the instructions
to be given to Mr Adams, and that without this there
would be no treaty at all. The Count de Vergennes
observes, that it is of great importance that the instructions
aforesaid be given as soon as possible to Mr Adams. And
the Minister desired the committee to press Congress to
have this done with all possible despatch.</p>

<p>He communicated to the committee the following particulars,
as a proof that this matter admits of no delay, and
that it is probable the negotiation will very soon be opened.
He told the committee that the English Ministry, in the
false supposition that they might prevail on the Court of
Madrid to sign a separate peace, had begun a secret negotiation
with that Court, by the means of Mr Cumberland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
but without any success. That the Court of Spain had
constantly founded her answer on her engagements
with his Most Christian Majesty. That on the other
side, the King of France had declared to the King, his
cousin, that the independence of the United States,
either in fact, or acknowledged by a solemn treaty,
should be the only foundation of the negotiations of
the Court of France with that of London. That the
British Court not seeming to be disposed to grant the
independency, it appeared the negotiation of Mr Cumberland
was superfluous. However, this English
emissary continued, and still continues, his residence
at Madrid, although he cannot have any expectation of
obtaining the object of his commission. That this
direct negotiation was known to all Europe, and that
it seemed to render every mediation useless. That,
however, the Empress of Russia, excited by motives
of friendship to the belligerent powers, and in consequence
of the share, which the association of the neutral
powers had given her in the general emergency, has
invited the king of France and the Court of London to
require her mediation. That the Court of London has
accepted the invitation with a kind of eagerness, and
at the same time desired the Emperor of Germany to
take a part in it. That the answer of the King of
France to the overtures of the Court of Petersburg
was, that he should be glad to restore peace by the
mediation of Catharine, but that it was not in his power
immediately to accept her offers, as he had allies
whose consent was necessary for that purpose.</p>

<p>To the same application made by the Court of
Petersburg to that of Madrid, this Court answered, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
having entered into a direct negotiation with the Court
of London, by the means of Mr Cumberland, it
thought proper to wait the issue of it before it had
recourse to a mediation. The Emperor, as has already
been observed, having been desired by the Court of
London to take part in the mediation, immediately
informed the King of France, as well as his Catholic
Majesty, of this circumstance, offering his co-mediation
to both the allied Monarchs. To this, the King of
France gave the same answer, which he had given to
the Empress of Russia. As to the King of Spain, he
again expressed his surprise at the English Ministry's
requesting a mediation, after having entered into a
direct negotiation; and he declared, that unless this
negotiation should be broken off by the English themselves, it
would be impossible for him to listen to a
mediation, which, in any other circumstance, would
be infinitely agreeable to him.</p>

<p>These answers, though of a dilatory nature, may be
looked upon as an eventual acceptation of the mediation.
The Minister observed, that it will be, in
effect, difficult to avoid it. That a refusal will not be
consistent with the dignity of the two powers, that had
offered their interposition. That the King is obliged,
from friendship and good policy, to treat them with
attention. He further observed, that the demands of
the King of France will be so just and so moderate,
that they might be proposed to any tribunal whatever.
That the only reason the King could have to suspend
a formal acceptation is, that, at the time the offer was
made, he was not acquainted with the intentions of his
allies, namely, Spain and the United States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span></p>

<p>The Minister observed to the committee, that in his
opinion this conduct must afford Congress a new proof
of the perseverance of the King in the principles of the
alliance, and of his scrupulous attention to observe his
obligations; he added, that, however, it is not without
inconveniency, that this dilatory plan has been adopted.
The distance between the allied powers of France and
the United States, has obliged the Court of Versailles
to adopt that plan, though liable to inconveniences, in
order to conform to the engagements made by the
treaties, to determine nothing into a negotiation without
the participation of Congress. Besides, several
States being invaded by the enemy, the French Council
thought it inconvenient to begin a negotiation under
these unfavorable circumstances. And being in hopes
that the diversions made by the King's arms, will prevent
the British from making very great exertions
against the Thirteen United States, the French Ministry
expected, that during the course of the present
campaign they might be enabled to present the situation
of their allies in a more favorable light to the
Congress, that might assemble for peace. These delays,
however, cannot with propriety take place for any
long time, and it was the opinion of the French Ministry,
that it would be contrary to decency, prudence,
and the laws of sound policy, again to refuse listening
to the propositions of peace made by friendly powers;
for which reason, the Chevalier de la Luzerne was
directed to lay all these facts confidentially before
Congress.</p>

<p>The Minister informed the committee, that it was
necessary, that the King should know the intentions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
the United States with regard to the proposed mediation,
and that his Majesty should be authorised by
Congress to give notice of their dispositions to all the
powers, who would take part in the negotiation for a
pacification. The Minister delivered his own opinion,
that he saw no inconveniency arising from the Congress
imitating the example of the King, by showing
themselves disposed to accept peace from the hands of
the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia.
He added, that Congress should rely on the justice and
wisdom of those two Sovereigns; and at the same
time, he renewed the assurances, that his Majesty will
defend the cause of the United States as zealously as
the interests of his own Crown.</p>

<p>He informed the committee, that according to all
accounts, the British Ministry were removing as far
as possible, in this negotiation, every idea of acknowledging
the independence of what they call their
Thirteen Colonies; and he said, that Congress would
judge by themselves, that the Court of London would
debate with the greatest energy and obstinacy the
articles relating to America. He availed himself of
this reflection to impress the committee with the
necessity Congress are under, of securing in their
favor the benevolence and good will of the mediating
powers, by presenting their demands with the greatest
moderation and reserve, save independence, which will
not admit of any modification. He further observed,
that it was possible the difficulty of making a definitive
peace might engage the mediators to propose a
truce; and that it was necessary, therefore, to authorise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
eventually the Plenipotentiary of the United
States to declare their intention thereon.</p>

<p>He further observed, that whatever might be the
resolution of Congress, they would do well to recommend
to their Plenipotentiary to adopt a line of
conduct, that would deprive the British of every hope
of causing divisions between the allies, and to assume
a conciliating character, as much as can be consistent
with the dignity of his constituents, and to show such
a confidence in the Plenipotentiary of his Most Christian
Majesty, as is due to a power so much interested
to support the dignity and honor of a nation, whose
independence they have acknowledged.</p>

<p>The Minister told the committee, that whatever
might be the resolution of Congress, respecting a peace
or a truce, it was necessary to carry on the war with
the utmost vigor. He urged reasons too well known
to Congress to be related.</p>

<p>He desired the committee to inform Congress, that
in case the offer of mediation from the two Imperial
Courts should become so serious and so pressing, as
to oblige the King to give a decisive answer, his Majesty
would accept of it conditionally for himself and
for the United States. The taking this resolution
would have no inconvenience, as the Court of France
knew no reasons, which could prevent them from following
the example of the King, by trusting their interests
in the hands of just and wise mediators, and
the refusal being liable to very dangerous consequences.
The Minister concluded the conference by observing,
that a great object was to secure the United States
from the proposition of <i>uti possidetis</i>; that the surest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
way to obtain that end was to reduce the English to
confess, that they are not able to conquer them. That
present circumstances require great exertions from the
consideration, and that it was plain that every success
gained by the army of Congress would infinitely
facilitate the negotiations of their Plenipotentiaries.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which your Excellency did
me the honor to write on the 23d of the past month, and
that of the Count de Rochambeau, with which it was
accompanied.</p>

<p>I wait with extreme impatience the news of the arrival
of the French division before New York, and no one can
desire more earnestly than I do to see it under your immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
command. I hoped that you would have been
this spring in the command of a more considerable body
of auxiliaries. The causes, which have hindered the execution
of that plan, have been so urgent and so decisive,
that I am sure you will approve them, after I shall have
had the honor of making you acquainted with them. I
have nevertheless been much pained, that I could not explain
to you this change of measures, and my attachment
to the cause, which you defend, has made me feel as sensibly
as any citizen of America all the delays, that could
happen to the assistance, which we wish to give to the
Thirteen States.</p>

<p>I am impressed with the necessity of maintaining a perfect
confidence with your Excellency upon these different
points, and I shall seize the first occasion which presents
itself to visit your army.</p>

<p>In the meantime I shall transmit to the Count de Grasse
what your Excellency did me the honor to communicate.
Be persuaded that I shall use the most pressing motives to
determine him, and I shall do it with so much the more
zeal, as I feel the necessity of it. I shall transmit to that
General an extract of your letter, and I know nothing more
likely to give weight to the demand, which I shall make
of him.</p>

<p>The King has charged me, Sir, to inform Congress,
that he grants them a gratuitous subsidy to enable them to
make the greatest efforts in the course of this campaign.
This subsidy, amounting to <i>six millions of livres tournois</i>,
is to be employed in the purchase of arms, ammunition,
and clothing, and it is the intention of the King, that the
surplus shall be at the disposal of Congress. I have not
been instructed as to what will be the exact amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
this surplus, but it is determined, that one million and a
half shall be employed by the Superintendent of Finance,
according to the directions, which you shall give him, after
the arrangements you shall make with him in the visit,
which he intends paying you.</p>

<p>I have informed Congress, and I intrust it to your Excellency,
that the Emperor of Austria, and the Empress
of Russia, have offered their mediation to the Court of
London, who has accepted it. The same has also been
offered to the Court of Versailles, and that of Madrid.
But they have given for answer, that time must be left for
Congress to determine, if it suits them to put the interests
of the Thirteen United States into the hands of the mediators.
In any event, it is of the greatest importance, that
the allies make all their efforts to drive the enemy from
this continent, and nothing will be more likely, than the
success of the confederate arms, to make a successful
negotiation.</p>

am apprehensive such a decided superiority of men may
not be drawn together by us, by the time the Count de
Grasse will be here, as to insure our success against the
enemy's most important posts; as his continuance in these
seas may be limited to a short period, and as the addition

would, in all human probability, terminate the matter very
soon in our favor. If these should likewise be your sentiments,

I entreat your Excellency, by the first good conveyance,
to represent the propriety and necessity of the measure to
the commanders in the West Indies; that by one great

the approaching negotiation.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF A CONFERENCE WITH THE FRENCH MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">In Congress, June 18th, 1781.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to confer with the Minister
Plenipotentiary of France, report,</p>

<p>That on the second conference with the Minister of
France, he communicated some parts of a despatch, dated
the 7th of August, 1780, the first part relating to losses
suffered by French merchants, either trading with private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
houses in America, or engaged in transactions of commerce
for Congress, or the several States. He informed
the committee that several papers, which should have accompanied
this despatch, were not come to hand, so that
he could not state what kind of compensation the merchants
might expect. The Minister, however, mentioned
in the conference, that without waiting the arrival of those
papers, which may have been lost, or may be delayed for a
long time, some recommendation might be thought proper
to be sent from Congress to the several States, in order to
prevent forever the effect of the tender laws operating
against foreign merchants; that this would be an encouragement
to commerce, and remove the fears of foreign
traders in their transactions with the citizens of the United
States. The Minister communicated that part of the Count
de Vergennes' letter relating to the discussion between him
and Mr John Adams, with respect to the depreciation of
the paper money, and the effect this had produced on the
French trade; however, he did not enter fully into the
matter, not being furnished with the proper papers.</p>

<p>The other objects of the communications of the Minister
of France were the measures taken by the Court of
Russia, and the northern powers, on account of the rights
of neutrality, and the conduct to be observed by the belligerent
powers towards subjects of neutral powers; and
he informed the committee, that those northern Courts had
made formal declarations to the powers at war respecting
the principles of neutrality; and that they had concluded
a convention for the security of their navigation and of
their fair trade. That this convention was particularly
obnoxious to the Court of London, as it was now obliged
to respect neutral flags, which it had till then treated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
the greatest severity, exercising against them every kind of
depredation, according to its former practice. That France
fully approved of that convention, the consequence of which
was, that all the powers concerned, while they did justice
to the principles of the King's Council, considered the
British more and more as the tyrants of the sea.</p>

<p>The King's Council, therefore, thought it proper to
transmit this intelligence to Congress, leaving it to their
wisdom to adopt the principles of the neutral powers laid
down so long ago as the 26th of July, 1778, in an ordinance
of the King, which the Minister of France delivered
several months ago, with other printed papers on the same
subject, to the Board of Admiralty. The Minister thought
it the more important for the United States to conform
their maritime laws to that system, as they would thereby
conciliate to themselves the benevolence of the neutral
powers. He observed, that American privateers had presumed
to stop neutral vessels loaded with English merchandise,
which had given rise to unfavorable observations
and complaints against the United States. He observed,
that Holland had taken a part in the association of the
northern Courts; and that therefore she ought to be comprehended
in the orders of Congress, if it should be
thought proper in those orders to mention the names of
particular powers. But if Congress adopted a conduct
similar to that of France, they would extend their orders
in favor of all neutral powers generally.</p>

<p>The Minister then gave a short historical account of the
negotiation of Mr Cumberland, observing that the matter
being now obsolete, it was sufficient to mention that this
agent, having made proposals of peace to the King of
Spain, the first question he was asked was, what were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
intentions of the Court of London respecting the United
States? That he, having no instructions on this subject,
or pretending to have none, had sent an express to London.
That the express had not returned when this letter
was written.</p>

<p>The Minister informed the committee, that the Court
of Versailles had neglected nothing to procure arms, ammunition,
and clothing, for Congress. That the good intentions
of the Court had not been well seconded by the
American agents; that it was their fault if these articles
had not been forwarded in time; that the Ministers did
not intend to accuse any one in particular; but were of
opinion, that Congress should inquire into the cause of the
delay, in order to inflict such punishment as would prevent
the like conduct in future.</p>

<p>The Minister then communicated the substance of a
despatch of the 9th of March, 1781; and entering fully
into the subject, he told us, that so early as the beginning
of the year 1780, he had informed Congress, that a mediation
might be opened in Europe. That the mediators
might propose the <i>uti possidetis</i> as the basis of the negotiation.
That it was of the utmost importance to prevent
the effect of a proposition, so inconsistent with the independence
of the United States. That the Court of France
wished to give them every assistance in their power; but
he had observed at the same time, that the political system
of the kingdom, being closely connected with that of other
European powers, France might be involved in difficulties,
which would require the greatest attention, and a considerable
part of her resources. That he had informed
Congress confidentially, that the death of the Sovereigns
of some of the European States, with whom the Court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
France had the most intimate connexion, might oblige
her to employ the greatest part of her resources to secure
her against the dangers, which might be occasioned by
such an event. That since that communication was made
to Congress, both those cases had happened. That the
Empress Queen was dead. That the Court of Versailles
flattered itself, that this will not at this time give rise to
any material change in the politics of the Courts of Vienna
and Berlin. That circumstances, however, are such, that
prudence dictates not to leave the frontier of France bordering
on Germany unprovided for defence. That the
character the King bears of guarantee or protector of the
liberties of the German empire, obliges him to be ready
to assist effectually the members of that body, whose safety
may be endangered, and of consequence occasions extraordinary
expenses. That France is at the same time obliged
to spare the land forces of the kingdom, and at the present
crisis not to keep them at too great a distance. That
this, however, is only a point of caution and prudence.
That the Court of France still hopes the issue will be
peaceable and agreeable to her wishes; but has thought it
proper to inform Congress of it.</p>

<p>That matters are different with respect to the Dutch.
That they are now in a state of war with the English; but
there is among them a party in favor of England; and notwithstanding
the accession of the two opposing provinces
to the resolution of the States for making reprisals, a mediation
has been entered into between London and the
Hague; and the Empress of Russia acts as mediatrix.
That it is evident the Court of London, by opening this
negotiation, designs to draw the Seven Provinces to her
side; and even goes so far as to expect, that she may employ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
the resources of the Dutch against France, either
directly or indirectly. That the disposition of that Republic
is still such as friends would wish. But the strongest
argument, which the British party make use of to
separate the Seven Provinces from France is, that they
are destitute of a naval force; that their seamen are captured
by the British; that all their riches will likewise fall a
sacrifice; and that their settlements in the East and West
Indies are in the greatest danger. That under these circumstances
it was become necessary for France to afford immediate
protection to the Dutch in Europe; and to make
without delay a diversion, which may possibly save their
East India possessions. That these measures had rendered
it actually impossible to send to the United States
the reinforcement, which was announced.</p>

<p>The Minister of France thinks, that this confidential and
friendly explanation of the situation of France will convince
Congress, that the King could not pursue a different
line of conduct; and that the consequences of the measures
he has taken must at last turn to their advantage.
That, however, Count de Rochambeau and M. Barras
will receive some reinforcements, and will inform the
Chevalier de la Luzerne how considerable they are.</p>

<p>The Minister told the committee, that the friendship
and benevolence of the King for the Thirteen United States
had engaged him to trust Congress with these details, observing
at the same time, that it would be proper to keep
them secret.</p>

<p>In giving an account of the subsidy granted by the
King of France, the Minister concluded by observing, that
the Count de Vergennes writes, that what remains of the
six millions, after purchasing the supplies of arms and ammunition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
would be at the disposal of Congress; or if
they should so direct, at the disposal of the commander in
chief, or of their financier, if there should be one; and
that the resolution Congress took on this subject should
be made known to the Ministry, that funds may be provided
accordingly. In the course of the conference the
Chevalier mentioned the sums, that had been procured for
these States since the beginning of the year 1780. That
in that year the Count de Vergennes had, on his own
credit, procured for Dr Franklin three millions of livres.
That in December Dr Franklin wanted one million more
to honor the bills drawn by Congress; and that he received
the fourth million. That in the course of the present
year, the Count has procured for him on loan four
millions of livres, which make eight millions borrowed on
the guarentee of France, since the aforementioned period.
And now the King makes a gratuitous donation of the
subsidy of six millions, which in the whole make up the
sum of fourteen millions, since the commencement of the
year 1780.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE FRENCH
MINISTER.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
In Congress, July 23d, 1781.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to receive the communications
of the Minister of France, delivered in the following
report.</p>

<p>The Minister, from his despatches of the 9th of January,
1781, communicated to your committee the causes which
delayed the measures, which the Court of France proposed
to take for the naval operations of this campaign, the
length of the passage of Count d'Estaing to Brest, and,
other circumstances not necessary now to be recapitulated;
and then told us that he was desired, in the meanwhile, to
continue to assure Congress, that the interest which his
Majesty takes in the American cause will essentially
influence his measures for the present campaign.</p>

<p>The Minister continued by observing, that the present
situation of affairs between Great Britain and Holland
presented a favorable opportunity for a union of the two
Republics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span></p>

<p>Your committee will not repeat the details of what has
happened between the two powers of England and Holland;
it is sufficient to observe, that Sweden and Denmark
have adopted the plan of the armed neutrality, framed by
the Empress of Russia; that the Dutch, upon invitation,
had done the same, and the Court of London, irritated by
this step, took hold of the pretence afforded by the papers
found on Mr Laurens, and published a manifesto on the
21st day of December, as well as a proclamation for expediting
letters of marque. That this state of affairs, and
the other consequences of this step, deserve the attention
of Congress. That, if their High Mightinesses should join
in this war, it would bring the two Republics to terms of
more intimate union. That the opinion of the Council of
the King was, that Congress ought not to neglect to send
to Holland a prudent and able man, with full powers. It
would likewise be advantageous to give proper instructions
to that Minister; and as it may happen in the course of
the negotiations that unforeseen incidents may present
themselves, and as it is impossible at this distance to have
quick information, it would be proper to have further instructions
given by Dr Franklin, in order to avoid all
inconsistency or contradiction, and that the political operations
of Congress, aiming towards the same end, may of
course be more successful.</p>

<p>The Minister communicated to your committee the
contents of another despatch, of the 19th of February last.
After stating some facts relating to Mr Laurens's capture,
and its consequences, which Congress are already acquainted
with, the Minister informed your committee, that
the Empress of Russia had, on the 5th of January, received
the accession of the United Provinces to the association of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
neutral powers, and that there was great probability, that
her Imperial Majesty would support the Dutch against the
tyranny of England, and that on every supposition, Congress
would do well to take such measures, as to prepare,
without delay, the means of uniting the interest of the two
Republics, by making proper advances to the States-General.
The Minister added, that he was authorised by
the King to offer Congress his interposition for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The Minister informed, that according to appearances
the Empress of Russia seemed to be well disposed to the
independence of the United States; and that these dispositions
give reason to think, that the Empress will see with
pleasure, that Congress have adopted her principles as to
the neutrality, and that the Count de Vergennes has sent
that resolution to the Marquis Verac, the Minister of

<p>The twentyninth article of the Treaty of Amity and
Commerce, between his Most Christian Majesty and the
United States, reserves to the two contracting powers, "the
liberty of having, each in the ports of the other, Consuls,
Vice-Consuls, Agents, and Commissaries, whose functions
shall be regulated by a particular agreement." In consequence
of this stipulation, the Court of Versailles has
caused a draft to be made of a convention, relative to the
establishment of Consuls, which the undersigned, Minister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
Plenipotentiary of France, has the honor to communicate
to Congress. It is the desire of his Majesty, that this draft
should be examined by Congress, and those points marked
which admit of no difficulty; and that the others should be
submitted to the examination of delegates appointed by both
parties, who may make such observations as they shall
judge proper, and propose such alterations as they may
think convenient. These objects will require discussion in
repeated conferences, and the undersigned entreats, that
Congress would determine in what manner these conferences
shall be held. The proposed convention requires
the most mature consideration of both parties; while at
the same time, it is equally the interest of both with all
speed to introduce consistency and uniformity into their
respective commercial establishments, and the undersigned
is of opinion, that Congress will think it necessary to prosecute
this business with all possible despatch.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
